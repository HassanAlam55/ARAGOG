      "HellaSwag is introduced as a new challenge dataset for commonsense natural language inference, designed to be trivial for humans but difficult for models, achieved through Adversarial Filtering."
    ],
    [
      "HellaSwag's complexity comes from its use of Adversarial Filtering to create examples that are easy for humans to solve but hard for models, aiming for a 'Goldilocks' zone of difficulty."

      "Adversarial Filtering, where discriminators iteratively select challenging machine-generated wrong answers, underpins the creation of HellaSwag's dataset."
    ],
    [
      "Models struggle with HellaSwag because it is designed to minimize dataset-specific biases that models have exploited, presenting a genuine test of commonsense reasoning."

    [
      "The significant performance gap on HellaSwag suggests that current models, while advanced, still fall short of truly understanding commonsense reasoning as humans do."
    ],
    [
      "The adversarial filtering process ensures that HellaSwag remains difficult for models by selecting only the most challenging wrong answers through iterative refinement."
