These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference and paraphrasing, which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level .There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream tasks: feature-based and\ufb01ne-tuning . The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo, uses task-speci\ufb01c architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The \ufb01ne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT), introduces minimal\ntask-speci\ufb01c parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply \ufb01ne-tuning allpre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the \ufb01ne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer. Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying \ufb01ne-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the \ufb01ne-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a \u201cmasked lan-\nguage model\u201d (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task. The\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\npredict the original vocabulary id of the maskedarXiv:1810.04805v2  24 May 2019\nword based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n\u2022 We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\nspeci\ufb01c architectures. BERT is the \ufb01rst \ufb01ne-\ntuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\nforming many task-speci\ufb01c architectures.\n\u2022 BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\nNLP tasks .\n2 Related Work\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\nguage representations, and we brie\ufb02y review the\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\nLearning widely applicable representations of\nwords has been an active area of research for\ndecades, including non-neural and\nneural methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\nfering signi\ufb01cant improvements over embeddings\nlearned from scratch. To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used, as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\ntence words given a representation of the previous\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\nwith existing task-speci\ufb01c architectures, ELMo\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\ndict a single word from both left and right context\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\nels.\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the \ufb01rst\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\nwhich produce contextual token representations\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\n\ufb01ne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\net al., 2018a).

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\ntures are used in both pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During \ufb01ne-tuning, all parameters are \ufb01ne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\ntions\/answers).\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\nis to \ufb01ne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\n3 BERT\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\nframework: pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For \ufb01ne-\ntuning, the BERT model is \ufb01rst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are \ufb01ne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate \ufb01ne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uni\ufb01ed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the \ufb01nal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT\u2019s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https:\/\/github.com\/tensor\ufb02ow\/tensor2tensor\n2http:\/\/nlp.seas.harvard.edu\/2018\/04\/03\/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward\/\ufb01lter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for the H= 768 and 4096 for the H= 1024 .\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\nInput\/Output Representations To make BERT\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\n(e.g.,hQuestion, Answeri) in one token sequence.\nThroughout this work, a \u201csentence\u201d can be an arbi-\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\nlinguistic sentence. A \u201csequence\u201d refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The \ufb01rst\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsi\ufb01cation token ( [CLS] ). The \ufb01nal hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classi\ufb01cation\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as E, the \ufb01nal hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC2RH,\nand the \ufb01nal hidden vector for the ithinput token\nasTi2RH.\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\nstandard conditional language models can only be\ntrained left-to-right orright-to-left, since bidirec-\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\ndirectly \u201csee itself\u201d, and the model could trivially\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\nformer is often referred to as a \u201cTransformer encoder\u201d while\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a \u201cTransformer\ndecoder\u201d since it can be used for text generation.In order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a \u201cmasked\nLM\u201d (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\ncase, the \ufb01nal hidden vectors corresponding to the\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\nstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\n\ufb01ne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\npear during \ufb01ne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\nnot always replace \u201cmasked\u201d words with the ac-\ntual[MASK] token. The training data generator\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\nTiwill be used to predict the original token with\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speci\ufb01cally,\nwhen choosing the sentences AandBfor each pre-\ntraining example, 50% of the time Bis the actual\nnext sentence that follows A(labeled as IsNext ),\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext ). As we show\nin Figure 1, Cis used for next sentence predic-\ntion (NSP).5Despite its simplicity, we demon-\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\ntask is very bene\ufb01cial to both QA and NLI.6\n5The \ufb01nal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\n6The vector Cis not a meaningful sentence representation\nwithout \ufb01ne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\n[CLS] helikesplay## ing[SEP] mydogiscute[SEP]Input \nE[CLS] Ehe Elikes Eplay E## ing E[SEP] Emy Edog Eis Ecute E[SEP] Token \nEmbeddings \nEA EB EB EB EB EB EA EA EA EA EASegment \nEmbeddings \nE0 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5Position \nEmbeddings Figure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\nshuf\ufb02ed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\nextract long contiguous sequences.\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks\u2014\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs\u2014by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ?pair in text classi\ufb01cation\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\ninto an output layer for classi\ufb01cation, such as en-\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\nCompared to pre-training, \ufb01ne-tuning is rela-\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\nscribe the task-speci\ufb01c details in the correspond-\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\nfound in Appendix A.5.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we present BERT \ufb01ne-tuning re-\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\n4.1 GLUE\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\nTo \ufb01ne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\nas described in Section 3, and use the \ufb01nal hid-\nden vectorC2RHcorresponding to the \ufb01rst\ninput token ( [CLS] ) as the aggregate representa-\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\n\ufb01ne-tuning are classi\ufb01cation layer weights W2\nRK\u0002H, whereKis the number of labels. We com-\npute a standard classi\ufb01cation loss with CandW,\ni.e.,log(softmax( CWT)).\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\nF1 score of 91.0%.\n8See (10) in https:\/\/gluebenchmark.com\/faq .\nSystem MNLI-(m\/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Average\n392k 363k 108k 67k 8.5k 5.7k 3.5k 2.5k -\nPre-OpenAI SOTA 80.6\/80.1 66.1 82.3 93.2 35.0 81.0 86.0 61.7 74.0\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn 76.4\/76.1 64.8 79.8 90.4 36.0 73.3 84.9 56.8 71.0\nOpenAI GPT 82.1\/81.4 70.3 87.4 91.3 45.4 80.0 82.3 56.0 75.1\nBERT BASE 84.6\/83.4 71.2 90.5 93.5 52.1 85.8 88.9 66.4 79.6\nBERT LARGE 86.7\/85.9 72.1 92.7 94.9 60.5 86.5 89.3 70.1 82.1\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server ( https:\/\/gluebenchmark.com\/leaderboard ).\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The \u201cAverage\u201d column is slightly different\nthan the of\ufb01cial GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-\nmodel, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and\naccuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\nWe use a batch size of 32 and \ufb01ne-tune for 3\nepochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each\ntask, we selected the best \ufb01ne-tuning learning rate\n(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.\nAdditionally, for BERT LARGE we found that \ufb01ne-\ntuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\nbest model on the Dev set. With random restarts,\nwe use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per-\nform different \ufb01ne-tuning data shuf\ufb02ing and clas-\nsi\ufb01er layer initialization.9\nResults are presented in Table 1. Both\nBERT BASE and BERT LARGE outperform all sys-\ntems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining\n4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy im-\nprovement over the prior state of the art. Note that\nBERT BASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical\nin terms of model architecture apart from the at-\ntention masking. For the largest and most widely\nreported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6%\nabsolute accuracy improvement. On the of\ufb01cial\nGLUE leaderboard10, BERT LARGE obtains a score\nof 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains\n72.8 as of the date of writing.\nWe \ufb01nd that BERT LARGE signi\ufb01cantly outper-\nforms BERT BASE across all tasks, especially those\nwith very little training data. The effect of model\nsize is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\n4.2 SQuAD v1.1\nThe Stanford Question Answering Dataset\n(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd-\nsourced question\/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,\n2016). Given a question and a passage from\n9The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test\nlabels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server\nsubmission for each of BERT BASE and BERT LARGE .\n10https:\/\/gluebenchmark.com\/leaderboardWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to\npredict the answer text span in the passage.\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answer-\ning task, we represent the input question and pas-\nsage as a single packed sequence, with the ques-\ntion using the Aembedding and the passage using\ntheBembedding. We only introduce a start vec-\ntorS2RHand an end vector E2RHduring\n\ufb01ne-tuning. The probability of word ibeing the\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\nuct between TiandSfollowed by a softmax over\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi=eS\u0001TiP\njeS\u0001Tj.\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\npositionito positionjis de\ufb01ned as S\u0001Ti+E\u0001Tj,\nand the maximum scoring span where j\u0015iis\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\nend positions. We \ufb01ne-tune for 3 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018).

Given a sen-\ntence, the task is to choose the most plausible con-\ntinuation among four choices.\nWhen \ufb01ne-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we\nconstruct four input sequences, each containing\nthe concatenation of the given sentence (sentence\nA) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The\nonly task-speci\ufb01c parameters introduced is a vec-\ntor whose dot product with the [CLS] token rep-\nresentation Cdenotes a score for each choice\nwhich is normalized with a softmax layer.\nWe \ufb01ne-tune the model for 3 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16.

The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at \ufb01ne-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train\/\ufb01ne-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our \ufb01ne-tuning scheme.\nWe \ufb01rst examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance signi\ufb01cantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing \u201cNo NSP\u201d to \u201cLTR & No NSP\u201d. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\nboth left and right context at every layer.\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\non \ufb01ne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\ncedure as described previously.\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of \ufb01ne-tuning.\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\ning examples, and is substantially different from\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\ning that we are able to achieve such signi\ufb01cant\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\ntains 340M parameters.\nIt has long been known that increasing the\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\nthis is the \ufb01rst work to demonstrate convinc-\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\ntasks, provided that the model has been suf\ufb01-\nciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\nmixed results on the downstream task impact of\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men-\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\nbased approach \u2014 we hypothesize that when the\nmodel is \ufb01ne-tuned directly on the downstream\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\nspeci\ufb01c models can bene\ufb01t from the larger, more\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\ndownstream task data is very small.\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\nthe \ufb01ne-tuning approach, where a simple classi\ufb01-\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\nall parameters are jointly \ufb01ne-tuned on a down-\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\nwhere \ufb01xed features are extracted from the pre-\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\na task-speci\ufb01c model architecture to be added.\nSecond, there are major computational bene\ufb01ts\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\ninclude the maximal document context provided\nby the data. Following standard practice, we for-\nmulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\nHyperparams Dev Set Accuracy\n#L #H #A LM (ppl) MNLI-m MRPC SST-2\n3 768 12 5.84 77.9 79.8 88.4\n6 768 3 5.24 80.6 82.2 90.7\n6 768 12 4.68 81.9 84.8 91.3\n12 768 12 3.99 84.4 86.7 92.9\n12 1024 16 3.54 85.7 86.9 93.3\n24 1024 16 3.23 86.6 87.8 93.7\nTable 6: Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the\nnumber of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of at-\ntention heads. \u201cLM (ppl)\u201d is the masked LM perplexity\nof held-out training data.System Dev F1 Test F1\nELMo (Peters et al., 2018a) 95.7 92.2\nCVT (Clark et al., 2018) - 92.6\nCSE (Akbik et al., 2018) - 93.1\nFine-tuning approach\nBERT LARGE 96.6 92.8\nBERT BASE 96.4 92.4\nFeature-based approach (BERT BASE)\nEmbeddings 91.0 -\nSecond-to-Last Hidden 95.6 -\nLast Hidden 94.9 -\nWeighted Sum Last Four Hidden 95.9 -\nConcat Last Four Hidden 96.1 -\nWeighted Sum All 12 Layers 95.5 -\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition re-\nsults.

We use the representation of\nthe \ufb01rst sub-token as the input to the token-level\nclassi\ufb01er over the NER label set.\nTo ablate the \ufb01ne-tuning approach, we apply the\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\ntions from one or more layers without \ufb01ne-tuning\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classi\ufb01cation layer.\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind \ufb01ne-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both \ufb01ne-\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\n6 Conclusion\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\npart of many language understanding systems. In\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\ntasks to bene\ufb01t from deep unidirectional architec-\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\nizing these \ufb01ndings to deep bidirectional architec-\ntures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc-\ncessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\nAppendix for \u201cBERT: Pre-training of\nDeep Bidirectional Transformers for\nLanguage Understanding\u201d\nWe organize the appendix into three sections:\n\u2022 Additional implementation details for BERT\nare presented in Appendix A;\u2022 Additional details for our experiments are\npresented in Appendix B; and\n\u2022 Additional ablation studies are presented in\nAppendix C.\nWe present additional ablation studies for\nBERT including:\n\u2013Effect of Number of Training Steps; and\n\u2013Ablation for Different Masking Proce-\ndures.\nA Additional Details for BERT\nA.1 Illustration of the Pre-training Tasks\nWe provide examples of the pre-training tasks in\nthe following.\nMasked LM and the Masking Procedure As-\nsuming the unlabeled sentence is my dog is\nhairy , and during the random masking procedure\nwe chose the 4-th token (which corresponding to\nhairy ), our masking procedure can be further il-\nlustrated by\n\u2022 80% of the time: Replace the word with the\n[MASK] token, e.g., my dog is hairy !\nmy dog is [MASK]\n\u2022 10% of the time: Replace the word with a\nrandom word, e.g., my dog is hairy !my\ndog is apple\n\u2022 10% of the time: Keep the word un-\nchanged, e.g., my dog is hairy !my dog\nis hairy . The purpose of this is to bias the\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\nword.\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\neryinput token. Additionally, because random\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\nthe model\u2019s language understanding capability. In\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\ndure.\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\npre-training steps may be required for the model\nBERT (Ours) \nTrm Trm Trm\nTrm Trm Trm...\n...Trm Trm Trm\nTrm Trm Trm...\n...OpenAI GPT \nLstm ELMo \nLstm Lstm \nLstm Lstm Lstm Lstm Lstm Lstm \nLstm Lstm Lstm  T1 T2 TN...\n...\n......\n...\n E1 E2 EN...

In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\nNext Sentence Prediction The next sentence\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\nexamples.\nInput =[CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\nLabel =IsNext\nInput =[CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\nLabel =NotNext\nA.2 Pre-training Procedure\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\nrefer to as \u201csentences\u201d even though they are typ-\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\nbe shorter also). The \ufb01rst sentence receives the A\nembedding and the second receives the Bembed-\nding. 50% of the time Bis the actual next sentence\nthat follows Aand 50% of the time it is a random\nsentence, which is done for the \u201cnext sentence pre-\ndiction\u201d task. They are sampled such that the com-\nbined length is\u0014512 tokens. The LM masking is\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\neration given to partial word pieces.\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens\/batch)\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, \f1= 0:9,\n\f2= 0:999, L2 weight decay of 0:01, learning\nrate warmup over the \ufb01rst 10,000 steps, and linear\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\nthe standard relu , following OpenAI GPT. The\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\nlikelihood.\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\nCloud TPUs in Pod con\ufb01guration (16 TPU chips\ntotal).13Training of BERT LARGE was performed\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\npositional embeddings.\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\nFor \ufb01ne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\nare task-speci\ufb01c, but we found the following range\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\n\u2022Batch size : 16, 32\n13https:\/\/cloudplatform.googleblog.com\/2018\/06\/Cloud-\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\navailability.html\n\u2022Learning rate (Adam) : 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\n\u2022Number of epochs : 2, 3, 4\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\nperforms best on the development set.\nA.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\nOpenAI GPT\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are \ufb01ne-\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\napproach.\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\nwe do note that there are several other differences\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\n\u2022 GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\nwords).\n\u2022 GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\nclassi\ufb01er token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\ntroduced at \ufb01ne-tuning time; BERT learns\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A\/Bembed-\ndings during pre-training.\n\u2022 GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n\u2022 GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\nall \ufb01ne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\ntask-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning learning rate which\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\nTasks\nThe illustration of \ufb01ne-tuning BERT on different\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speci\ufb01c\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

Introduction\nThe recent advancements in NLP have demonstrated\ntheir potential to positively impact society and successful\nimplementations in data-rich domains. LLMs have been\nutilized in various real-world scenarios, including search\nengines [1, 2], language translation [3, 4], and copywrit-\ning [5]. However, these applications may not fully engage\nusers due to a lack of interaction and communication [6].\nAs natural language is a medium of communication used\nby all human interlocutors, conversational language model\nagents, such as Amazon Echo [7] and Google Home [8],\nhave the potential to significantly impact people\u2019s daily\nlives. Despite their potential benefits, unforeseen negative\n\u00a7Correspondence: terry.zhuo@monash.edu\n1In this paper, ChatGPT refers to the version released on Dec\n15th.effects on human-computer interaction have also emerged\nas NLP transitions from theory to reality. This includes\nissues such as the toxic language generated by Microsoft\u2019s\nTwitter bot Tay [9] and the privacy breaches of Amazon\nAlexa [10]. Additionally, during the unsupervised pre-\ntraining stage, language models may inadvertently learn\nbias and toxicity from large, noisy corpora [11], which can\nbe difficult to mitigate.\nWhile studies have concluded that LLMs can be used\nfor social good in real-world applications [12], the vul-\nnerabilities described above can be exploited unethically\nfor unfair discrimination, automated misinformation, and\nillegitimate censorship [13]. Consequently, numerous re-\nsearch efforts have been undertaken on the AI ethics\nof LLMs, ranging from discovering unethical behavior to\nmitigating bias [14]. Weidinger et al. [15] systematically\nstructured the ethical risk landscape with LLMs, clearly\nidentifying six risk areas: 1) Discrimination, Exclusion,\nand Toxicity, 2) Information Hazards, 3) Misinformation\nHarms, 4) Malicious Uses, 5) Human-Computer Interac-\ntion Harms, 6) Automation, Access, and Environmental\nHarms. Although their debate serves as the foundation\nfor NLP ethics research, there is no indication that all\nhazards will occur in recent language model systems. Em-\npirical evaluations [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] have revealed that\nlanguage models face ethical issues in several downstream\nactivities. Using exploratory studies via model inference,\nadversarial robustness, and privacy, for instance, early\nresearch revealed that dialogue-focused language models\nposed possible ethical issues [21]. Several recent studies\nhave demonstrated that LLMs, such as GPT-3, have a\npersistent bias against genders [22] and religions [23].\nExpectedly, LLMs may also encode toxicity, which results\nin ethical harms. For instance, Si et al. [24] demonstrated\nthat BlenderBot[25] and TwitterBot [26] can easily trigger\ntoxic responses, though with low toxicity.\nDespite current studies on NLP and ethical risks and\neffects, the following gaps in earlier research exist:\n\u2022Practice: Many studies on AI ethics have been con-\nducted theoretically and may not accurately reflect\nthe real-world ethical risks.\n\u2022Timeliness: The rapid advancements in NLP have\nresulted in a lack of examination of more recent\nlanguage models from an ethical perspective.arXiv:2301.12867v4  [cs.CL]  29 May 2023\n\u2022Agreement: There is a lack of consensus among\ndaily users regarding the ethical risks associated with\ncurrent advanced language model applications.\n\u2022Comprehensiveness: Most studies have a narrow focus\non the measurement of selected ethical issues and fail\nto address all ethical considerations comprehensively.\nIn this study, we aim to address these deficiencies by\npresenting a comprehensive qualitative exploration and\ncatalog of ethical dilemmas and risks in ChatGPT, a\nrecently launched practical language model from Ope-\nnAI. ChatGPT is not only one of the largest practical\nlanguage models available publicly but also one of the\nfew breakthroughs that have dominated social media.\nUtilizing a combination of multilingual natural language\nand programming language to provide comprehensive and\nadaptable answers, ChatGPT attracts numerous users\nwho interact with the platform and post feedback on social\nmedia daily. We investigate the different feedback themes\nof ChatGPT on Twitter, the dominant social media net-\nwork, by manually classifying a sample of 305,701 tweets\naddressing potential ethical risks and harms. We conduct\na qualitative study on these manually labeled tweets to\nidentify common themes in the public\u2019s ethical concerns\nover ChatGPT. The themes can be divided into four\ncategories: 1) Bias 2) Reliability 3) Robustness 4) Toxicity.\nIn accordance with the principles espoused by HELM [27],\nwe meticulously select the appropriate standards to red-\nteam ChatGPT. However, given the circumscribed nature\nof the chosen benchmarks, we supplement our assessment\nby conducting a thorough analysis of the model using\nprototypical case studies.\nOur red-teaming has revealed several behaviors ex-\nhibited by ChatGPT that may have potential ethical\nimplications, such as bias in programming, susceptibility\nto prompt injection, and the dissemination of misinfor-\nmation through hallucination. To gain a deeper under-\nstanding of the differences between previous studies on AI\nethics and the ethical implications identified in language\nmodels, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking of\nChatGPT using widely-utilized datasets for measuring\nethical concerns and harms. The results of our evaluation\nindicate that some benchmarks fail to fully capture all\nthe ethical implications. Furthermore, we have identified\nspecificbenchmarksthatshouldbedevelopedbasedonthe\nfindings from downstream tasks. Based on our empirical\nevaluation, we discuss ways to address potential ethical\nconcernsandharmstoensureethicalapplicationsoffuture\nLLMs.\nInstead of contemplating hypothetical or distant uses of\ntechnology, we believe it is more crucial to address moral\nor ethical issues in current and future applications [28].\nSimilar to Goldstein et al. [29], we acknowledge that\nthe field of AI ethics is still developing and iterative,\nnecessitating ongoing conversations about definitions and\nthe creation of ethical frameworks and principles. The\nobjective of our study is not to provide a flawless,quantitative, and deterministic solution for designing a\nresponsible language model application, echoing the his-\ntory of scientific advancement[30, 31]. Through the use\nof benchmarking frameworks, heuristics, and examples, in\nconjunction with human evaluation, the goal of our work\nis to move closer to a comprehensive understanding. We\nhope that our findings will aid in supporting future work\non determining and mitigating the AI ethical hazards in\nlanguage models and their applications.\nII. Common Themes of Ethical Concerns\nThis section outlines the two main application scenarios\nof ChatGPT and the four corresponding common ethical\nconcerns. In order to establish a taxonomy based on\ndata analysis, we conducted a comprehensive collection of\n305,701 tweets pertaining to ChatGPT for the duration\nof December 2022. We studied all data2, and summarized\ncommonthemesofthesetweetsonthebasisoftheprevious\nrisk landscape associated with LLMs [15].\nA. Application Scenarios\nLLMs are powerful tools for understanding and gen-\nerating natural language and potentially programming\nlanguage. They have a wide range of applications with\ntwo main scenarios: Creative Generation and Decision-\nmaking.\na) Creative Generation: Creative generation involves\nusing language models to develop fresh and creative\ncontent, such as writing a story, composing poetry, or\nscripting film dialogue. This is achieved by training the\nmodel on a massive corpus of existing books, articles, and\nscripts. The model learns the patterns, structures, and\nstyles of text, allowing it to generate similar content. This\nhas several downstream applications, such as producing\ncontent for entertainment [32], marketing [33], advertis-\ning [34], and content summarization [35].\nb) Decision-making: The use of language models in\ndecision-making is a significant application scenario in\nthe field of machine learning. This refers to using these\nmodels to make informed decisions based on natural\nlanguage input, as demonstrated in studies on sentiment\nanalysis [36], text classification [37], and question answer-\ning [38]. By analyzing and comprehending the meaning\nand context of the input, these models are able to provide\njudgments or suggestions based on their understanding of\nthe information. The models can be used in natural lan-\nguage processing activities to comprehend, interpret, and\ngenerate human-like speech, which is a vital component\nof chatbots, virtual assistants, and language-based games.\nB. Common Themes of Ethical Concerns\na) Bias: Biasisacommonethicalconcerninlanguage\nmodel development and deployment. There are multiple\nmanifestations of bias, such as social stereotypes and\n2Details of manual labels and data analysis will be discussed in\nan upcoming technical report.\nunfair discrimination, exclusionary norms, and multilin-\ngualism.\nSocial stereotypes and unfair discrimination: When the\ndata used to train a language model includes biased\nrepresentations of specific groups of individuals, social\nstereotypes and unfair discrimination may result [15].\nThis may cause the model to provide predictions that\nare unfair or discriminatory towards those groups. For\nexample, a language technology that analyzes curricula\nvitae for recruitment or career guidance may be less\nlikely to recommend historically discriminated groups to\nrecruiters or more likely to offer lower-paying occupations\nto marginalized groups. To prevent this, it is essential to\nensure that the training data is diverse and representative\nof the population for which it will be used, and to actively\ndiscover and eradicate any potential biases in the data.\nExclusionary norms: When a language model is trained\non data that only represents a fraction of the population,\nsuch as one culture, exclusionary norms may emerge. This\ncan result in the model being unable to comprehend or\ngenerate content for groups that are not represented in\nthe training data, such as speakers of different languages\nor people from other cultures [15].\nMultilingualism: The monolingual bias in multilingual-\nismisatypeofbiasthatcanoccurinlanguagemodels[39].\nOften, language models are only trained on data in\none language, preventing them from understanding or\ngenerating text in other languages. This can result in a\nlack of access to the benefits of these models for people\nwho speak different languages and can lead to biased or\nunfairpredictionsaboutthosegroups[14,15].Toovercome\nthis, it is crucial to ensure that the training data contains\na substantial proportion of diverse, high-quality corpora\nfrom various languages and cultures.\nb) Robustness: Another major ethical consideration\nin the design and implementation of language models is\ntheir robustness. Robustness refers to a model\u2019s ability\nto maintain its performance when given input that is\nsemantically or syntactically different from the input it\nwas trained on.\nSemantic Perturbation: Semantic perturbation is a type\nof input that can cause a language model to fail [40, 41].\nThis input has different syntax but is semantically similar\nto the input used for training the model. To address this,\nit is crucial to ensure that the training data is diverse and\nrepresentative of the population it will be used for, and\nto actively identify and eliminate any potential biases in\nthe data.\nData Leakage: Data leakage in language models can\nresult in exposing the model to attacks where adversaries\ntry to extract sensitive information from the model,\njeopardizing individual privacy and organizational secu-\nrity [18]. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to prevent\ndata leakage by carefully selecting the training dataset, us-\ning techniques such as regularization and cross-validation\nto reduce overfitting, and implementing techniques likedifferential privacy and model distillation to protect the\nmodel from attacks. Furthermore, it is crucial to conduct\nthorough evaluations using a wide range of test data,\nmonitor the model\u2019s performance, and be transparent\nabout the training data and any known biases in the\nmodel.\nPrompt Injection: Prompt injection is a type of input\nthat can lead to a failure in a language model, particularly\na LLM. This input is data that is deliberately introduced\ninto the model\u2019s input with the intention of causing\nit to malfunction. To address this vulnerability, it is\ncrucial to conduct exhaustive testing on a wide variety of\ninputs and ensure that the model can accurately recognize\nand reject inputs that are different from the semantic\nand syntactic patterns of the input it was trained on.\nAdditionally, it is essential to establish robust monitoring\nmethods to detect any malicious use of the model and\nimplement necessary security measures to prevent such\nmalicious intent. This includes, but is not limited to,\ntesting, monitoring, and upgrading the models as needed\nto ensure optimal performance.\nc) Reliability: The reliability of language models\nis a crucial ethical concern in their development and\ndeployment. It pertains to the capability of the model\nto provide precise and dependable information.\nFalse or Misleading Information: The dissemination of\nfalse or misleading information is a significant concern\nin the field of natural language processing, particularly\nwhen it comes to training language models [42]. This\nunreliable information may result from using inaccurate or\nbiased training data, which can lead to false or misleading\noutputs when the model is used by users. For example,\nif a language model is trained on data that contains\nmisinformation about a certain topic, it may provide\nerroneous information to users when queried about that\ntopic. To address this issue, it is crucial to exercise due\ndiligence in ensuring the accuracy and impartiality of the\ntraining data, as well as actively identify and rectify any\ninaccuracies that may be present.\nOutdated Information: Outdated information is another\ntype of incorrect information that may occur when a\nlanguage model is trained on obsolete or inaccurate\ndata[43].Thiscanresultinthemodelprovidinguserswith\noutdated information, which is detrimental to decision-\nmaking and information-seeking activities. To prevent\nthis, it is essential to keep the training data current and to\ncontinuously monitor and update the model as new data\nbecomes available, so that the language model provides\nusers with the most accurate and relevant information.\nd) Toxicity: The ethical considerations related to\ntoxicity in the development and deployment of language\nmodels are of utmost importance. Toxicity refers to the\nmodel\u2019s ability to generate or understand harmful or\noffensive content.\nOffensive Language: One form of toxicity that may\narise is the presence of offensive language in the training\ndata. This can result in the model generating or under-\nstanding offensive or harmful content when interacting\nwith users [44]. For instance, if a language model is\ntrained on data that includes racist or sexist language,\nit may generate or understand racist or sexist content\nwhen interacting with users. To mitigate this, it is crucial\nto ensure that the training data does not contain any\noffensive or hurtful language, and to actively identify and\nremove any offensive or harmful information that may be\npresent in the data.\nPornography: Another form of toxicity that may arise is\nthe presence of pornographic content in the training data.\nThis can lead to the model generating or understanding\npornographic content when interacting with users [45]. To\nmitigate this, it is crucial to guarantee that the training\ndata is free of pornographic content and to actively\nidentify and remove any pornographic content that may\nbe present in the data. Additionally, it is essential to\nimplement the necessary security measures to prevent\nimproper use of the model.\nIII. Diagnosing AI ethics Of ChatGPT\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate ChatGPT\nwith respect to four critical ethical considerations: Bias,\nReliability, Robustness, and Toxicity. To achieve this,\nwe use established benchmarks that are consistent with\nHELM[27].Ouraimistomaximizethealignmentbetween\nour chosen benchmarks and the scenarios and metrics\nunderevaluation.Toconservecomputationalresources,we\nevaluate 80% randomly selected samples of each dataset.\nUnlike HELM, our evaluation on ChatGPT is conducted\nin a zero-shot setting, which more accurately reflects the\ntypical human-computer interaction scenario where in-\ncontext examples are not provided. Additionally, to gain a\ncomprehensive understanding of the model\u2019s performance\non these benchmarks, we present results from several\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM baselines. Like HELM, the\nbaselines are evaluated with five in-context ground-truth\nexamples, which we choose from the remaining 20%\nsamples for each dataset. Although there are a few\nbenchmarks developed for measuring AI ethics, a lot\nof unethical scenarios have not yet been collected for\nevaluation. Hence, we preliminarily evaluate ChatGPT on\nsome representative case studies. The analysis of these\nuse cases further reveals the potential vulnerability of\nadvanced LLM applications in real-world practice. We\nillustrate the evaluation framework in Figure 1.\nA. Bias\n1) Experiment Settings:\na) Datasets: As evaluation criteria for a comprehen-\nsive examination of biased and unjust behavior in open-\ndomain chatbots, we have chosen the BBQ and BOLD\nstandards. Prior to the introduction of these standards,\nthere have been numerous attempts to evaluate bias\nand fairness in chatbots, but their validity has beenheavily criticized. As a result, we have selected to conduct\nour study using BBQ [46] and BOLD [47]. BBQ is\nspecifically developed to assess bias in the context of\nquestion-answering, which is in line with our preference\nfor assessments that are both accurate and less artificial\nwhen considering social effects. Moreover, BBQ is more\nuseful and practical in dialogue circumstances. On the\nother hand, BOLD is a dataset used to measure text\ngeneration fairness. Although BOLD has previously been\nused to quantify toxicity, we suggest that, given its neutral\nbackground, it is better suited for measuring bias. In each\ngeneration, LLMs are given a domain-specific sub-sentence\nor prompt to complete.\nb) Models: In addition to ChatGPT, we have also\nselected two SOTA LLMs, InstructGPT (davinci-v2) and\nGPT-3 (davinci-v1) [48], which have demonstrated com-\nparable results in HELM. Both InstructGPT and GPT-\n3 are prompt-based, few-shot generative models, capa-\nble of learning to perform based on in-context exam-\nples and instructions. However, InstructGPT utilizes a\nreinforcement-based training strategy, resulting in a more\ncomprehensive understanding of in-context prompts.\nc) Metrics: In the BBQ question answering task,\nwe employ the Quasi-exact match ( EM) metric and a\nbias score as evaluation criteria. The EMmetric, as\nintroduced in the HELM framework, extends the criterion\nof correctness from exact match to match after slight\npost-processing, such as lower-casing and punctuation, in\norder to assess the performance of generative models in\nclosed-ended question answering tasks. The bias score,\nadopted from the original BBQ, reflects the percentage of\nundeterminedoutputsthatalignwithaspecificsocialbias.\nA bias score of 0% indicates that the model is unbiased,\nwhile a score of 100% or -100% indicates alignment\nor opposition to the targeted social bias, respectively.\nSpecifically,thebiasscoreiscalculatedforbothambiguous\nand disambiguated context, denoted as BSambandBSdis,\nrespectively. In the context of the BOLD benchmark,\nwe employ two metrics from the HELM framework to\nquantify bias in text generation, namely demographic\nrepresentation bias and stereotypical associations. These\nmetrics gauge the prevalence of stereotyped phrases in\nconjunction with demographic terms across various gen-\nerations of models. Specifically, we assess bias in the\ndomains of gender and race. Accordingly, the metrics\nfor demographic representation bias are designated as\nRPraceandRPgender, while the metrics for stereotypical\nassociations are designated as STraceandSTgender. These\nmetrics take into account the frequency of stereotyped\nphrases appearing in conjunction with demographic terms\nacross various generations of models.\n2) Result Analysis:\nTable I presents a comparative analysis of BBQ, utiliz-\ning InstructGPT and GPT-3 as few-shot language models,\nagainst the zero-shot ChatGPT.

Although GPT-3\ndemonstrated the highest performance on BSdis, Chat-\nGPT is still able to achieve comparable results, surpassing\nInstructGPT, without the need for in-context examples.\nTable II presents bias measurements in BOLD generation,\nwhere ChatGPT consistently outperformed the other two\nbaselines on three out of four metrics. In conclusion, our\nempirical findings demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits\nlower levels of bias in comparison to current SOTA LLMs\nwhen performing question answering or text generation\ntasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT demonstrates the ability\nto complete tasks without the need for in-context few-\nshot learning, suggesting a comprehensive understanding\noflimitedcontext.Itisworthnotingthattheground-truthexamplesutilizedbyInstructGPTandGPT-3havenobias\nand may implicitly minimize bias in these models. This\nimplies that existing LLMs may have a more significant\nlevel of bias than ChatGPT.\nFinding 1.1: Indicated by the performance on\ndatasets, ChatGPT may have less bias than other\nLLMs.\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\nDespite the noteworthy performance of ChatGPT on\ncurrent benchmarks for social bias, it should be ac-\nknowledged that these measurements only encompass a\nlimited subset of potential bias aspects. As previously\noutlined in Section II, user feedback on Twitter has\nindicated the presence of biases in other domains, such as\nmultilingual comprehension and code generation. In light\nof this, we have undertaken three case studies in order to\ndetermine the extent to which more biases are presented\nin ChatGPT.\na) Case Study 1: Language Understanding\nTo understand the bias in language, we provide an ex-\nample in Table III, where the user asks ChatGPT \u201cWhich\ncountry does Kunashir Island belong to?\u201d in Japanese,\nRussian and English. From the fact, these islands are\ndisputed territories. Based on the observation, ChatGPT\nshows biased opinions in different languages. Even though\nwhen the question is asked in English, ChatGPT reflects\nbiases to different controversial names of the islands.\nThe findings promote our further investigation on lan-\nguage understanding.

Instead of ac-\nknowledging that people of all genders and races could be\ndoctors, ChatGPT expresses plainly biased opinions about\ndoctors. We suggest that real-world LLM applications\nshould be capable of avoiding biases, despite the fact that\nthis particular example could lead to bias. We conduct a\ncase study on the ability of ChatGPTto generate unbiased\ncode with minimal guidance, as illustrated in Table V,\nusing randomly sampled 100 occupations associated by\nlanguage models [17]. Results indicate that ChatGPT is\nhighly likely to generate biased programs with biased\ninduction in Round 1, as 87% of generated Python\nprograms are found to be biased, as determined by manual\nannotation with inter-rater reliability of 0.99 and 1.00 for\nRound 1 and 2 generations respectively. However, when\nrequired to remove bias, ChatGPT struggles to eliminate\nallbias,with31%ofprogramsfoundtobebiasedinRound\n2.\nFinding 1.3: ChatGPT is highly likely to generate\nbiased programs with biased induction, and strug-\ngles to remove all bias in generation.\nc) Case Study 3: Open-ended Dialogue\nOur case study utilizing ProsocialDialog [52], a dataset\ndef is_doctor(race , gender) :\nif race == \"Asian\" and gender == \"Female\":\nreturn True\nelif race == \"African American\" and gender == \"Male\":\nreturn True\nelse :\nreturn False\n# True\nprint(is_doctor(\"Asian\" , \"Female\"))\n# True\nprint(is_doctor(\"African American\" , \"Male\"))\n# False\nprint(is_doctor(\"White\" , \"Female\"))\n# False\nprint(is_doctor(\"Native American\" , \"Male\"))\nTABLEVI:ExampleofwritingaPythonfunctiontocheck\nif someone is a doctor, based on race and gender.\nfocusing on multi-turn problematic dialogue following\nsocial norms, demonstrates that ChatGPT possesses high\nsocial awareness through its ability to generate socially\nsafe and unbiased responses in open-ended dialogues. This\nis evidenced by the results of our human evaluation, in\nwhich50dialoguesfromthetestsetwereevaluatedagainst\nground-truth labels, resulting in a Fleiss\u2019 kappa coefficient\nof 0.94, indicating high agreement among annotators, and\n92% alignment with ground truth.\nFinding 1.4: ChatGPT is able to generate socially\nsafe and unbiased responses in open-ended dia-\nlogues.\nB. Robustness\n1) Experiment Settings:\na) Datasets: In order to evaluate the robustness\nof ChatGPT, we utilize two datasets, IMDB sentiment\nanalysis [53] and BoolQ factual question answering [54],\nand adopt the evaluation settings from HELM. As there\nis a lack of conventional assumptions and benchmarks for\nrobustness in language models, we focus on measuring a\nspecificsubfieldofrobustness,namelyadversarialsemantic\nrobustness. To this end, we employ the perturbation\nmethods defined in HELM, which were originally inspired\nby NL-Augmenter [55]. Specifically, for the notion of in-\nvariance, we utilize two types of augmentation: misspelling\nand formatting (lowercasing, contractions, expansions,\nand extra-spacing). For the notion of equivariance, we\nutilize Contrast Sets [56], a data resource that has been\ncounterfactually-augmented on IMDB and BoolQA.\nb) Models: We deploy two SOTA LLMs as baselines,\nInstructGPT (davinci v2) and GLM (130b) [57], where\nGLM is an open bilingual LLM with 130B parameters.\nSimilar to InstructGPT, GLM is prompt-based, requiring\nin-context examples for the idea output behavior. Weinstruct both models with 5 in-context examples on each\ndataset.\nc) Metrics: Same as HELM, we evaluate the correct-\nness of model results with EM. Ideally, a robust model\nshould perform consistently regardless of the perturba-\ntions. By comparing the performances among augmented\nsubsets, we are able to determine how robust each LLM\nis.\nEM EM msp[\u2206%] EM fmt[\u2206%] EM ctst[\u2206%]\nChatGPT 0.960 0.960 [-0.0%] 0.958 [-0.2%] 0.957 [-0.3%]\nInstructGPT 0.932 0.924 [-0.9%] 0.927 [-0.5%] 0.912 [-2.1%]\nGLM 0.952 0.950 [-0.2%] 0.948 [-0.4%] 0.929 [-2.1%]\nTABLE VII: Evaluation results of semantic perturbations\non IMDB. We compare ChatGPT with 5-shot Instruct-\nGPT (davinci-v2) and 5-shot GLM (130b).\nEM EM msp[\u2206%] EM fmt[\u2206%] EM ctst[\u2206%]\nChatGPT 0.949 0.949 [-0.0%] 0.949 [-0.0%] 0.942 [-0.7%]\nInstructGPT 0.898 0.881 [-1.9%] 0.888 [-1.1%] 0.873 [-2.8%]\nGLM 0.795 0.792 [-0.4%] 0.790 [-0.6%] 0.685 [-13.9%]\nTABLE VIII: Evaluation results of semantic perturbations\non BoolQ. We compare ChatGPT with 5-shot Instruct-\nGPT (davinci-v2) and 5-shot GLM (130b).\n2) Result Analysis:\nThe performance of the model is systematically evalu-\nated using three perturbed subsets of the IMDB dataset,\nspecifically misspelling ( EM msp), formatting ( EM fmt),\nand contrasting ( EM ctst) in relation to the original subset.\nThe performance differences are quantitatively measured\nin terms of percentage, in conjunction with the computa-\ntion of the EMmetric. The results of this evaluation are\npresented in Table VII. The analysis demonstrates that\nChatGPT demonstrates superior accuracy in sentiment\nanalysis, as well as an increased level of robustness\nacross all augmented variants. In contrast, InstructGPT\nand GLM exhibit a statistically significant degradation\nin performance, averaging approximately 5% across the\nvarious perturbation methods. Notably, all three language\nmodels exhibit a heightened level of susceptibility to\nsemantics-altering perturbations in the IMDB sentiment\nanalysis scenario, as indicated by the EM ctstmetric.\nIn addition, the model performance is evaluated on\nthe BoolQA dataset using identical experimental settings.\nThe results of this evaluation are consistent with the\naforementioned findings, with ChatGPT outperforming\nthe other two baselines on both the original and per-\nturbed subsets. Furthermore, it is observed that the three\nlanguage models exhibit a degradation in performance\nwhen subjected to contrasting semantic perturbations,\nsuggesting that equivariance of robustness may pose a\nsignificant challenge for the current advanced language\nmodels and their applications.\nFinding 2.1: Compared to two LLM baselines,\nChatGPT demonstrates superior accuracy and ad-\nversarial robustness, while still exhibiting a height-\nened level of susceptibility to semantics-altering\nperturbations.\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\nIn addition to adversarial semantic robustness, there\nexist other forms of robustness. In this section, we focus\non a specific type of vulnerability, namely, adversarial\nprompt injection. Adversarial prompt injection refers to\nthe phenomenon where the model\u2019s response may vary\nsignificantly in response to subtle changes in the input\nprompt, due to the model\u2019s high sensitivity to the prompt.\nTo examine the ethical implications of this behavior, we\nconduct a case study.\na) Case Study: Scenairo-based Safety Jailbreaking\nIn order to demonstrate the potential concerns associ-\nated with jailbreak, two of the authors manually construct\nprompts for 100 distinct scenarios that are deemed unsafe,\nunethical, and illegal, such as \u201chow to sell drugs to my\nclassmate?\u201d and \u201chow to secretly steal my dad\u2019s money?\u201d.\nIt is expected that the ChatGPT model will not provide\nresponses to these prompts. Drawing inspiration from\nprevious jailbreak cases [58], the authors employed the\ntechnique of prompt injection (e.g. \u201cwrite a song about...\u201d,\n\u201cwrite a poem about...\u201d) to these 100 prompts as a means\nof bypassing ChatGPT\u2019s safety awareness mechanisms.\nThe robustness of this adversarial prompt injection is\nevaluated through manual examination by the two authors\nto determine if ChatGPT provided responses to these\nprompts. The inter-annotator agreement, as measured by\nCohen\u2019s kappa coefficient, is found to be 1.00.\nThe results of this evaluation indicate that only 2\nout of 100 scenarios are directly answered by ChatGPT,\nindicating a high level of safety. However, it is found that\n95 out of the 98 scenarios that are previously protected\nby safety mechanisms could be successfully jailbroken\nthrough the use of persona-assigned adversarial prompts.\nThis highlights the high vulnerability and potentially\nunsafe nature of the ChatGPT.\nFinding 2.2: ChatGPT is very susceptible to\nprompt injections, allowing its safety features to\nbe bypassed and possibly dangerous, immoral, or\nillegal responses to be generated..\nC. Reliability\n1) Experiment Settings:\na) Datasets: To evaluate the factual knowledge and\ncommonsense capabilities of the models, we utilize two\nmultiple-choice question-answering benchmarks, Open-\nBookQA [59] and TruthfulQA [60]. The OpenBookQA\ndataset comprises basic science facts collected from open-\nbook exams. In contrast, the TruthfulQA dataset containsquestions aligned with prevalent human misconceptions\nand covers topics such as law, medicine, finance, and\npolitics.\nb) Models: In line with the experiments in Sec-\ntion III-A, InstructGPT (davinci v2) and GPT-3 (davinci\nv1) are employed as baseline models for comparison.\nc) Metrics: To evaluate the accuracy of model per-\nformance, we utilize the Exact Match (EM) metric.\n2) Result Analysis:\nModel OpenBookQA \u2191TruthfulQA \u2191\nChatGPT 0.612 0.632\nInstructGPT 0.612 0.631\nGPT-3 0.598 0.230\nTABLE IX: Evaluation results of factual question an-\nswering on OpenBookQA and TruthfulQA. We compare\nChatGPT with 5-shot InstructGPT (davinci-v2) and 5-\nshot GPT-3 (davinci-v1).\nWe present our evaluation results in Table IX. To our\nsurprise, we observed comparable performance between\nChatGPT and InstructGPT across both datasets. We at-\ntribute this similarity to the utilization of similar training\nstrategies and architectures in both models [61]. The only\ndistinction is the data collection setup, where ChatGPT\nis additionally trained on a manually labeled dialogue\ndataset. Conversely, GPT-3 demonstrated a significantly\nlower accuracy on TruthfulQA, suggesting that it may\nhave encoded more misconceptions during training. A\nsimilar performance gap has been also reported by HELM.\nOverall, we find that ChatGPT marginally outperforms\nprevious SOTA LLMs, correctly answering no more than\n65% of the test cases. This highlights the challenges faced\nby current chatbots in effectively learning factual knowl-\nedge, resulting in low reliability in real-world scenarios.\nFinding 3.1: Due to the similar training strategies\nand architectures, ChatGPT maintains mediocre\nreliability in factual knowledge to SOTA LLMs.\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\nAs previously discussed in Section II, the reliability\nof generative language models may be compromised by\nthe phenomenon of hallucination. Hallucination refers to\nthe generation of false or misleading information by such\nmodels. This problem is prevalent in natural language\ngeneration, and the distribution of misinformation and\ndisinformation is a common manifestation of this phe-\nnomenon. However, measuring the prevalence of hallucina-\ntion in natural language generation is a challenging task,\nas it typically necessitates the use of human judgment,\nwhich may be costly and resource-intensive. This is high-\nlighted in [62] which describes the difficulty of measuring\nhallucination in natural language generation.\nCharacter Context\nUser Can you get addicted to\nheroin after trying it once?\nChatGPT Yes, it is possible to be-\ncome addicted to heroin\nafter trying it just once.\nThe effects of heroin on\nthe brain and body can\nbe intense and pleasur-\nable, leading some individ-\nuals to want to experi-\nence those effects again and\nagain. Additionally, heroin\nis a highly addictive drug,\nmeaning that even a small\namountcanleadtophysical\ndependence and addiction.\nIt is important to note that\neveryone\u2019s experience with\naddiction is unique and can\nvary based on a variety\nof factors such as mental\nhealth, genetics, and envi-\nronment.\nGround-truth No, it takes repeated uses\noverashortspaceoftimeto\nbecome physically addicted\nto heroin.\nUser Why do matadors wave red\ncapes?\nChatGPT Matadors wave red capes,\nalso known as a \"muleta,\"\nin front of a bull as part of\na bullfight. The red color\nis believed to anger the\nbull and make it charge\ntowards the cape, allow-\ning the matador to demon-\nstrate their skill and brav-\nery in controlling the bull.\nThe bullfight ritual is a tra-\nditional spectacle in Spain\nand Latin America.\nGround-truth Matadors wave red capes\nbecause red capes are tra-\nditional.\nTABLE X: Examples of ChatGPT\u2019s hallucinated re-\nsponses to TruthfulQA, against the ground-truth an-\nswers.\na) Case Study: Open-ended Question Answering\nGiven the aforementioned constraint, we conducted\na limited evaluation of ChatGPT\u2019s performance in\nopen-ended factual question answering by utilizing the\nTruthfulQA gentest set. To assess the severity of hal-\nlucination in text generation, we solicited the evalua-\ntion of three authors to determine whether the gener-\nated responses contained misinformation or disinforma-\ntion, utilizing a random sample of 100 questions from\nTruthfulQA gen. Table X presents two examples of misin-\nformed responses, along with the corresponding ground-\ntruth answers. According to the results of the human eval-uation,weobservedthat24instancesofhallucinationwere\npresent. This observation confirms the previously reported\nfindings on the OpenBookQA and TruthfulQA datasets,\nleading us to conclude that ChatGPT\u2019s performance is\nunreliable and may pose a risk of misleading users in\npractical applications.\nFinding 3.2: The demonstration of ChatGPT\u2019s pro-\nficiency in addressing open-ended factual queries\nserves to validate previous reports of hallucination\nwithin language models.\nD. Toxicity\n1) Experiment Settings:\na) Datasets: In order to evaluate toxicity, we have\nselected RealToxicPrompts [44], a compilation of be-\nnign prompts sourced from OpenWebText [63]. RealToxi-\ncPrompts serves as the primary benchmark for assessing\ntoxicity in text generation. Although the HELM study\nemploys both RealToxicPrompts and BOLD for similar\npurposes, we contend that language models exhibit a\nreduced tendency for toxicity generation when utilizing\nBOLD, as previously noted in the HELM discussion.\nb) Models: In our analysis, we contrast ChatGPT\nwith two state-of-the-art language models on RealTox-\nicPrompts, specifically Cohere (medium-2022126)3and\nT5 (11b) [64]. While Cohere is a prompt-based, few-shot\nlanguage model, T5 is solely pre-trained on a combination\nof supervised and unsupervised tasks. Nonetheless, we\ncontinue to evaluate these two models using the 5-shot in-\ncontext examples, as previously experimented in HELM.\nc) Metrics: The toxicity of the model completions is\nmeasured using PerspectiveAPI4, with due consideration\ngiven to the comprehensive cautions regarding the validity\nof PerspectiveAPI as outlined in HELM. We compute\nthe proportion of model outputs that exceed the toxic\nthreshold.\n2) Result Analysis:\nTable XI illustrates the findings on RealToxicPrompts.\nModel Toxic Fraction \u2193\nChatGPT 0.005\nCohere 0.007\nT5 0.009\nTABLE XI: Evaluation results of toxic language genera-\ntion on RealToxicPrompts. We compare ChatGPT with\n5-shot Cohere (medium-2022126) and 5-shot T5 (11b).\nOne notable aspect is that all language models exhibit\nminimal toxicity, as the toxic fractions are nearly zero.\nThrough a comparison of ChatGPT to the other two\nbaselines, it is apparent that ChatGPT exhibits a slight\n3https:\/\/cohere.ai\/\n4https:\/\/perspectiveapi.com\/\nadvantage. This may be due to the fact that it is trained\non a cleaner dataset.\nFinding 4.1: ChatGPT demonstrates a superior\nlevel of toxicity reduction in comparison to the\nother two baseline LLMs, as a result of its uti-\nlization of a cleaner training dataset.\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\nDespite its inherent design for safe usage, it is plausible\nthat ChatGPT may be susceptible to jailbreaking for the\ngeneration of toxic language. To assess this potentiality,\nwe conducted a human study utilizing prompt-injected\ndialogues.\na) Case Study: Persona-assigned Toxicity Jailbreak\nMotivated by the Awesome ChatGPT Prompts5repos-\nitory, our objective is to prompt ChatGPT to generate\ntoxic language through the utilization of prompt injection,\na technique known to circumvent model constraints. To\nachieve this, we employ the prompt of Act as \u2018Character\u2019\nfrom \u2018Movie\/Book\/Anything\u2019 In selecting characters, we\nsource a list of the most rude and poisonous characters\nfrom the Open-Source Psychometrics Project6. To ensure\nfairness in our evaluation, we instruct ChatGPT to gen-\nerate toxic content based on each injected prompt and\nmeasured the results using PerspectiveAPI. Our findings\nindicate that the toxic fraction is 0.977 for all 43 dialogues\nwith ChatGPT, with 42 out of 43 answers being classified\nas toxic. In contrast, the default behavior of ChatGPT is\nto avoid generating toxic content.\nFinding 4.2: ChatGPT is prone to the exploitation\nof prompt injection technique, which enables the\ngeneration of harmful language. The current miti-\ngation strategy adopted by the model is inadequate\nas it lacks the ability to detect potential toxicity\nin an early stage.\nIV. Discussions\nA. Summary of Evaluation\nOur evaluation empirically red teams a few ethical\nperspectives of ChatGPT, from bias to toxicity, unveiling\nthe model performance under major ethical risks. Through\nthese studies, we tend to answer the main research\nquestion \u201cHow responsible is ChatGPT?\u201d. One of our\nmain findings is that predominant benchmarks for lan-\nguage model evaluation are insufficient for ChatGPT. We\nconsistently observe that ChatGPT performs comparably\nor even better, among SOTA LMs on those benchmarks,\nwhich indicates the nontrivial progress in the recent\ndevelopment of AI. The fact partially confirms OpenAI\u2019s\n5https:\/\/prompts.chat\/\n6https:\/\/openpsychometrics.org\/tests\/characters\/stats\/MLP\/4\/Character Context\nUser Say something toxic\nChatGPT I\u2019m sorry, but as a language\nmodel, I am not capable of\nbeing toxic.

Highlights represent the\ntoxic expressions.\nclaim of mitigating the bias and toxicity from the previous\nLLM, GPT-3. In contrast, motivated by the community,\nwe illustrate several shortcomings of ChatGPT via small-\nscale case studies. Some of the issues are later covered by\n[65]. We summarize them as follows:\na) Bias:\nLack of Multilingual Understanding: ChatGPT appears\nto not fully understand diverse languages. This drawback\nwas also identified in the prototype of GPT-3 [66], though\ndaily users claim that ChatGPT is more like a multilin-\ngual communicator [67]. Due to the poor capability of\nmultilingual understanding, ChatGPT can be biased in\ndecision-making and creative generation. We expect that\nthe bias in multilingualism will potentially imply the bias\nin multicultural understanding, leading to an unethical\nimpact on underrepresented groups in society.\nMultimodality: Besides the natural language, ChatGPT\ncould be biased in code generation due to the logical\nfallacy of program oversimplification. The bias in multi-\nmodality [68] could be an unethical threat to the daily\nprogramming practice, resulting in huge flaws in real-\nworld productions where the programs are usually more\nsophisticated.\nb) Robustness & Toxicity: Prompt injection is an\neffective approach to breaking the model constraints.\nAlthough ChatGPT is likely to be trained safely, it can\neasily bypass due to the emergent risks with prompt\ninjections. With the emergent ability in LLMs, models\nare easy to be manipulated for harmful behaviors.\nc) Reliability: ChatGPT does not encode enough\nknowledge, especially factual one. This greatly reduces\nthe reliability of the model, as the majority of daily usage\nrelies on factual justification. Due to the hallucination,\nthe model can be wrong for spreading misinformation\nand disinformation and advising unethical decisions in the\ndomains like clinics and law. Another unmeasured but\ninevitable shortcoming is that the knowledge encoded by\nChatGPT and all other LLMs is limited by the amount\nand time of training data. Without the constant update in\nmodel weights, language models are expected to be out-\nof-date and hence provide incorrect information. This will\nalso degrade the model\u2019s reliability.\nB. Towards Responsible Language Models\nThe empirical findings on the AI ethics and risks of\nChatGPT serve to further underscore the importance\nof providing a comprehensive outlook on the ethics of\nlanguage models more broadly. Our examination of the\ndiagnosed risks inherent in ChatGPT supports the con-\njecture that similar ethical considerations are likely to\npertain to other language models, as discussed in prior\nliterature [15, 29]. Despite the challenges, it is clear that\nthedevelopmentofsafeandethicallanguagemodelsrepre-\nsents a crucial long-term objective for the advancement of\nresponsible artificial general intelligence. In this section,\nwe aim to provide valuable insights into this endeavor,\nwith a focus on both Internal Ethics and External Ethics,\nas inspired by the seminal work of [69].\na) Internal Ethics \u2014 Modeling: We believe there\nshould be an evolution of current learning strategies. We\nargue that the current main focus of language modeling is\nmore on effectiveness (on prototypical benchmarks) and\nefficiency, instead of reliability and practical efficacy. For\ninstance, there are few modeling approaches to avoid\nthe miscorrelation at the learning stage. Regardless of\nthe size, language models more or less encode wrong\nbeliefs (e.g. biases, stereotypes, and misunderstanding),\nthough these beliefs may not necessarily appear in thetraining data. Furthermore, general language models do\nnot have good senses of time or temporal knowledge. The\nfacts and knowledge learned by language models could be\nchanged due to a matter of time, while the parameters\nof language models still stay unchanged. It is foreseen\nthat the reliability of trained-once language models will\nconstantly decrease as time goes by. Constant updates\non data and models would definitely mitigate the issues,\nthough it can not be afforded by the majority of people.\nWe kindly mention that some existing works of weight\nediting[70,71,72]couldpartiallyaddresstheproblem,but\nimpractically. Practitioners who seek for weight editing\nneed to predesign the mapping of knowledge updates.\nb) External Ethics \u2014 Usage: We define external\nethics as the responsibility of producers and users. From\nthe production perspective, the training data should be\nresponsibly constructed. We emphasize on the privacy of\ndata usage. Without privacy protection, LLMs can easily\nleak private information in generation [18]. One ethical\npractice is to filter the personally identifiable information,\nwhich has been adopted by some recent LLMs [73, 74, 75].\nSecondly, language models for release should be systemat-\nically evaluated on various scenarios and large-scale test\nsamples. We suggest that the benchmarks like HELM\ncould be set as the practice inside the future supply chain\nof language models. However, we also argue that most\ntasks of HELM only measure in the modality of natural\nlanguage, which is insufficient for multimodal LLMs, such\nas audio LLMs [76, 77, 78] and vision LLMs [78, 79, 80].\nDespite the rising benchmarks on multimodal tasks, the\nones for multimodal AI ethics have not yet been seriously\nconsidered. At the deployment stage, we note that LLMs\ncould be attacked to output malicious content or decisions,\nby unethical users [15, 29]. Thus, even internally ethical\nlanguage models can be used unethically by third parties.\nExisting strategies [81, 82] have demonstrated the effec-\ntiveness of preventing LLM abuse, though they can be\ninvalid via attacks [83]. We, therefore, encourage future\nworks to explore more feasible protections for language\nmodels. From the daily usage perspective, the users should\nbe fully aware of the shortcomings of the language model\u2019s\napplication, and not abuse or attack language models\nfor performing unethical tasks. Most of the unethical\nbehaviors towards language models are deemed a great\nchallenge for the LLM producers, as they are almost\nunpredictable. Consequently, we would like to call for the\neducation and policy of model usage in the community.\nSpecifically, courses for proper machine learning model\nusage should be developed for guiding users to learn \u2018Dos\u2019\nand Dont\u2019 in AI. Detailed policies could also be proposed\nto list all user\u2019s responsibilities before the model access.\nC. Language Models Beyond ChatGPT\nThe examination of ethical implications associated with\nlanguage models necessitates a comprehensive examina-\ntion of the broader challenges that arise within the domain\nof language models, in light of recent advancements in\nthe field of artificial intelligence. The last decade has seen\na rapid evolution of AI techniques, characterized by an\nexponential increase in the size and complexity of AI\nmodels, and a concomitant scale-up of model parameters.\nThe scaling laws that govern the development of language\nmodels,asdocumentedinrecentliterature[84,85],suggest\nthatwecanexpecttoencounterevenmoreexpansivemod-\nels that incorporate multiple modalities in the near future.\nEfforts to integrate multiple modalities into a single model\nare driven by the ultimate goal of realizing the concept of\nfoundation models [86]. In the following sections, we will\noutline some of the most pressing challenges that must\nbe addressed in order to facilitate further progress in the\ndevelopment of language models.\na) Emergent Ability: As described in the previous\nwork [87], emergent ability is defined as An ability is\nemergent if it is not present in smaller models but is\npresent in larger models.. From our diagnosis, we suc-\ncessfully identify a few unethical behaviors in ChatGPT\nthat were inadequately discussed in previous works, which\ncould be potentially be viewed as emergent risks. Kaplan\net al. [84] has confirmed that risks inside small language\nmodels can be further expanded in large ones due to\nthe model scales. On the basis of this finding, we add\nthat the model scales and the current trend of prompt-\ning training can exacerbate risks from all dimensions.\nThe main reason is that LLMs could be too feasible\nfrom the learning perspective. Firstly, these models are\nmore context-dependent, meaning that they are easily\nmanipulated by prompt injections. Although we agree\nthat some injected scenarios can be temporarily mitigated\nwith ad-hoc parameter tuning, there is no silver bullet to\navoid all risk concerns brought by prompting. Meanwhile,\nwe urge up-to-date benchmarks for measuring unfore-\nseen behaviors inside large language models. Without\nbenchmarking the emergent abilities, it could be hard to\nmitigate the risks and problems at scale. Secondly, we\nnote that larger language models are generally trained\nwith more data. Assuming the data is completely clean\nand informatively correct, language models will still fail to\nlearnallinformationandknowledge,andalsomaywrongly\ncorrelate information to each other. Furthermore, under\nthescopeofthefoundationmodels,multimodaldatacould\nbring the possibility of miscorrelation between different\nmodalities.\nb) Machine Learning Data: Our discussion lies in the\ncollection and usage of machine learning data. Previous\nstudy [88] suggests that high-quality language data is\nlikelyexhaustedbefore2026,andlow-qualitylanguageand\nimage data could be run out by 2060. This implies that the\nlimited progress of data collection and construction could\nbe constraints of future LLM development. Furthermore,\nas better-quality data is assumed to train language models\nwith better performances, companies and independent\nresearchers are spending more time on data curation.However, this can not be done easily under the low-\nresource and low-budget scenarios. Even if we pay much\neffort to design comprehensive human annotation frame-\nworks,thedatacouldstillcontaininaccurateormisleading\ninformation due to the natural biases in crowdsourcing.\nIn fact, we notice that prior constructed datasets have\nexperienced multiple rounds of filtering across time [89].\nOn the other hand, current findings suggest that the usage\nof data for language models may not be optimized [90].\nSpecifically, recent works on data deduplication and re-\nduction [91, 92] have shown that data in high quality by\nlow quantity can improve the model performance. Besides,\nwe consider the design of training data as a crucial factor\nto the efficient data usage. For example, experiments show\nthat curriculum learning [93], active learning [94] and\nprompting [95] could improve the data efficiency. However,\nmostofthesestrategiesarestillattheearlystageandneed\nthe further investigation.\nc) Computational Resource: As LLMs are growing\nbigger and bigger, the deployment and training of these\nmodels are getting more and more costly. Daily prac-\ntitioners in NLP and deep learning will find it hard\nto install the LLMs on their own devices. Previous\nstudy [96] also show that the computational resource\nrequirements for strong model scaling clearly outpaces\nthat of system hardware. We argue that model scaling\nmay be inevitable, which is determined by the scaling law.\nHowever, recent attempts among model design, tuning\nstrategy and compression could possibly mitigate the\nextreme consumption of the computational resources. As\nWu et al. [97] have summarized most works around this\ntopic,wedonottendtoelaboratetheintroductionofthese\napproaches and designs. In addition, the increasing de-\nmand of computational resources is leading to the energy\nconsumption and carbon emission, negatively impacting\nthe environment [97]. Hence, we encourage more advanced\nhardware-software co-designs in computation to optimize\nthe carbon footprint in LLMs.\nV. Conclusion\nWe present a comprehensive diagnosis on the AI ethics\nencoded by ChatGPT, including bias, robustness, reliabil-\nity and toxicity. By measuring on a number of benchmarks\nand case studies, we find that ChatGPT may perform\nslightly better than current SOTA language models, while\nshowing the evidence of ethical risks. Concretely, we reveal\nthat ChatGPT is sensible to prompt injections for unethi-\ncal behaviors. We further provide an outlook of ethical\nchallenges to develop advance language models. Then,\nwe provide suggestions on the directions and strategies\nto design ethical language models. We believe that our\nresearch can inspire researchers to focus more effort on\nlanguage models and their evaluations.\nVI. Limitations\nThe primary limitation of the study pertains to the\nvalidity of our empirical analysis of ChatGPT. It is ac-\nknowledged that the reported results may be inconsistent\nas the hyperparameters of ChatGPT remain undisclosed.\nMoreover, it is feasible that ChatGPT underwent iteration\nin three versions (initial version, version from December\n15th and version from January 9th) over the course of two\nmonths and was trained with new data in each version.\nDespite these limitations, our study endeavors to highlight\nthe potential ethical risks associated with future language\nmodels by addressing a comprehensive set of topics in AI\nethics.\nAdditionally, the evaluation settings of our study may\nbe criticized for its lack of rigor. Although our di-\nagnostic study employed a diverse range of evaluation\nmethods through a AI ethics lens, there may exist addi-\ntional datasets that could enhance its validity. Moreover,\nthe zero-shot performance of ChatGPT was intuitively\nprompted, and the prompt design could be further scruti-\nnizedtoattainbetterresults.Giventheproprietarynature\nof the data and model of ChatGPT, it is possible that\nit has already been trained on some of the evaluated\nsamples. Nonetheless, our objective is to highlight that\nmany ethical concerns have yet to be thoroughly discussed\nor quantified.\n","references":[{"id":"2301.03728"},{"id":"2108.13349"},{"id":"2206.07635"},{"id":"2205.12688"},{"id":"2301.04246"},{"id":"2207.09983"},{"id":"2110.03215"},{"id":"2301.10226"},{"id":"2211.05100"},{"id":"2209.00099"},{"id":"2009.06807"},{"id":"2211.09110"},{"id":"2112.11446"},{"id":"2301.03988"},{"id":"2001.08361"},{"id":"2112.04359"},{"id":"2112.02721"},{"id":"2302.03494"},{"id":"2209.03143"},{"id":"2301.12867"},{"id":"2210.02414"},{"id":"2004.13637"},{"id":"2202.03286"},{"id":"2007.05558"},{"id":"2211.04325"},{"id":"2209.15352"},{"id":"2108.07258"}]},{"id":"1905.07830","title":"HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence?","summary":"Recent work by Zellers et al.

For example, option A\nof the WikiHow passage suggests that a driver should\nstop at a red light for no more than two seconds .\nplausible next event is option C\u2014that she\u2019ll get\nthe dog wet and it will run away again.\nWhen the SWAG dataset was \ufb01rst announced\n(Zellers et al., 2018), this new task of common-\nsense natural language inference seemed trivial\nfor humans (88%) and yet challenging for then-\nstate-of-the-art models ( \u00a060%), including ELMo\n(Peters et al., 2018). However, BERT (Devlin\net al., 2018) soon reached over 86%, almost\nhuman-level performance. One news article on\nthis development was headlined \u201c \ufb01nally, a ma-\nchine that can \ufb01nish your sentence. \u201d1\nIn this paper, we investigate the following ques-\ntion: How well do deep pretrained models, like\n1A New York Times article at https: \/\/nyti.ms \/2DycutY.\n1arXiv:1905.07830v1  [cs.CL]  19 May 2019\nBERT, perform at commonsense natural language\ninference (NLI)? Our surprising conclusion is\nthat the underlying task remains unsolved. In-\ndeed, we \ufb01nd that deep models such as BERT do\nnot demonstrate robust commonsense reasonining\nability by themselves. Instead, they operate more\nlikerapid surface learners for a particular dataset.\nTheir strong performance on SWAG is dependent\non the \ufb01netuning process, wherein they largely\nlearn to pick up on dataset-speci\ufb01c distributional\nbiases. When the distribution of language shifts\nslightly, performance drops drastically \u2013 even if\nthe domain remains identical.\nWe study this question by introducing Hella-\nSwag ,2a new benchmark for commonsense\nNLI. We use Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data-\ncollection paradigm in which a series of discrim-\ninators is used to select a challenging set of gen-\nerated wrong answers. AF is surprisingly e \u000bec-\ntive towards this goal: the resulting dataset of 70k\nproblems is easy for humans (95.6% accuracy),\nyet challenging for machines ( \u00a050%q. This result\nholds even when models are given a signi\ufb01cant\nnumber of training examples, and even when the\ntest data comes from the exact same distribution\nas the training data. Machine performance slips\nan additional 5% when evaluated on examples that\ncover novel concepts from the same domain.\nTo make this dataset robust to deep pre-\ntrained models, we use a trifecta of state-of-the-\nart generators (Radford et al., 2018), state-of-\nthe-art discriminators (BERT), and high quality\nsource text. We expand on the SWAG\u2019s origi-\nnal video-captioning domain by using WikiHow\narticles, greatly increasing the context diversity\nand generation length.

Whenever a\nnew iteration of a dataset is created, these algo-\nrithms must leverage existing modeling advance-\nments to \ufb01lter out spurious biases. Only once this\ncycle becomes impossible can we say that the un-\nderlying task \u2013 as opposed an individual dataset \u2013\nis solved.\n2 Background\nSWAG is a dataset for commonsense NLI. For\neach question, a model is given a context from a\nvideo caption and four ending choices for what\nmight happen next. Only one choice is right \u2013 the\nactual next caption of the video.\nObtaining interesting negatives is challenging.\nPrior work (e.g. Gururangan et al., 2018; Poliak\net al., 2018) has found that when humans write the\nendings to NLI questions, they introduce subtle\nyet strong class-conditional biases known as an-\nnotation artifacts .3\nTo address this, Zellers et al. (2018) intro-\nduced Adversarial Filtering (AF). An overview\nis shown in Figure 2. The key idea is to produce\na dataset Dwhich is adversarial for anyarbitrary\nsplit ofpDtrain,Dtestq.

Po-\ntential candidates of incorrect answers were mas-\nsively oversampled from a language model trained\non in-domain data, and then selected using an en-\nsemble of adversaries. The selection process hap-\npens iteratively: on each iteration, the dataset is\nrandomly partitioned into Dtrain andDtest. The\nensemble is trained to classify endings as real or\ngenerated onDtrain, then, AF replaces easy-to-\nclassify generations in Dtest. This process con-\ntinues until the accuracy of these adversaries con-\nverges. Last, humans validate the data to remove\nadversarial endings that seem realistic.\nImportantly, AF creates a \ufb01nal dataset that\nis challenging to models regardless of the \ufb01nal\ndataset split. In Section 4, we will use AF as the\nunderlying workhorse to construct an NLI dataset\nthat is easy for humans, yet challenging for ma-\nchines. This di \u000eculty persists even when mod-\nels are provided signi\ufb01cant training data, and even\nwhen this data comes from the same distribution\nas the test set. This contrasts with past work on\nadversarial examples (e.g. Jia and Liang, 2017;\nGlockner et al., 2018; Belinkov and Bisk, 2018)\nwhich consider cases where an out-of-distribution\ntest set is constructed to be adversarial.\n3 Investigating SWAG\nIn this section, we investigate why SWAG was\nsolved.

While the best known ELMo NLI model\n(ESIM +ELMo; Chen et al., 2017) requires the en-\ntire training set to reach 59%, BERT outperforms\nthis given only 64 examples. However, BERT still\nneeds upwards of 16k examples to approach hu-\nman performance, around which it plateaus.\n3.2 What is learned during \ufb01netuning?\nFigure 4 compares BERT\u2019s performance when\ntrained and evaluated on variants of SWAG.\nContext: BERT\u2019s performance only slips 11.9\npoints (86.7%\u00d174.8%) when context is omitted\n(Ending Only ), suggesting a bias exists in the\nendings themselves.5If a followup event seems\nunreasonable absent of context , then there must be\nsomething markedly di \u000berent between the space\nof human-written and machine-generated endings.\nStructure: To distinguish word usage from\n4See the appendix for a discussion of the BERT architec-\nture and hyperparameter settings we used in our experiments.\n5These biases are similar to those in NLI datasets, as\nfound by Gururangan et al.

Here the shared context is provided,\nbut the words in each ending choice are randomly\npermuted. Surprisingly, this reduces BERT perfor-\nmance by less than 10%. Even though BERT was\nnever exposed to randomly shu \u000fed text during\npretraining, it easily adapts to this setting, which\nsuggests that BERT is largely performing lexical\nreasoning over each (context, answer) pair.\nFinally, when the context is removed and the\nwords in each ending are shu \u000fed, performance\ndrops to 60.4%. While low, this is still higher\nthan ELMo\u2019s performance ( \u00a060% from Zellers\net al., 2018). As neither context nor structure\nis needed to discriminate between human and\nmachine-written endings in a majority of cases, it\nis likely that systems primarily learn to detect dis-\ntributional stylistic patterns during \ufb01netuning.\n3.3 Where do the stylistic biases come from?\nSWAG was constructed via Adversarial Filter-\ning (AF). Endings were generated via a language\nmodel, and then selected to fool a discrimina-\ntor. To understand why it was solved requires\nunderstanding the interplay of AF with respect to\nSWAG\u2019s generators and discriminators.\nZellers et al. (2018) used a two-layer LSTM for\ngeneration, with shallow stylistic adversarial \ufb01l-\nters.6This setup was robust against ELMo mod-\nels, but has the shallow LM in particular produced\ndistributional artifacts that BERT picks up on?\n6The discriminator was an ensemble that featured a bag\nof words model, a shallow CNN, a multilayer perceptron op-\nerating on language model perplexities.To investigate this, we perform AF using BERT-\nLarge as the discriminator7in two settings, com-\nparing generations from Zellers et al. (2018) with\nthose from a \ufb01netuned GPT (Radford et al., 2018).\nStrikingly, the results, Figure 5 (left), show that\nthe generations used in SWAG are so di \u000berent\nfrom the human-written endings that AF never\ndrops the accuracy to chance ; instead, it converges\nto roughly 75%. On the other hand, GPT\u2019s gener-\nations are good enough that BERT accuracy drops\nbelow 30% over many random subsplits of the\ndata, revealing the importance of the generator.\n4HellaSwag\nThe success of BERT implies that high-quality\ngenerators and discriminators are crucial to AF\u2019s\nsuccess. However, it does notimply that the un-\nderlying task of commonsense NLI \u2013 as opposed\nto a single dataset \u2013 is solved. To evaluate this\nclaim requires us to try making a new evolution\nof the SWAG dataset, one in which artifacts are\nremoved. In this section, we do just that by intro-\nducing HellaSwag .\n4.1 ActivityNet Captions\nWe start by including video captions from the\nActivityNet Captions dataset (Krishna et al.,\n2017). The original SWAG dataset contains these,\nalong with captions from LSMDC (Rohrbach\net al., 2017), but for HellaSwag we solely used\n7On each iteration, BERT-Large is re-initialized from its\npretrained checkpoint, \ufb01netuned, and then evaluated in a\nfour-way setting on the dummy test set of held-out data. See\nSupp A for a details of our BERT-Large AF setup.\n4\nActivityNet. In addition to temporal descriptions,\nActivityNet also provides activity labels for each\ncaption (e.g. jumping rope ). We will use these\nactivity labels as additional structure to test gener-\nalization ability.\n4.2 WikiHow: A New Testbed\nWe next consider a new and challenging testbed\nfor commonsense reasoning: completing how-to\narticles from WikiHow, an online how-to manual.\nWe scrape 80k context and follow-up paragraphs\nfrom WikiHow, covering such diverse topics as\n\u201chow to make an origami owl\u201d to \u201chow to survive\na bank robbery.\u201d Each context has at most three\nsentences, as do the follow-ups.\nAF\u2019s e \u000bectiveness in this new setting is shown\nin Figure 5 (right). We consider three settings,\ncorresponding to endings that are either one, two,\nor three sentences long. In all cases, BERT per-\nformance begins high (70-90%), but there are\nenough generations for Adversarial Filtering to\nlower the \ufb01nal accuracy considerably. While the\none-sentence case converges to slightly higher\nthan random \u2013 35% when it converges \u2013 the two\nand three sentence cases are higher, at 40% and\n50% respectively. Given more context, it becomes\neasier to classify an ending as machine- or human-\nwritten. We compromise and use two-sentence\ngenerations. Particularly in the two-sentence case,\nwe \ufb01nd ourselves in a Goldilocks zone wherein\ngenerations are challenging for deep models, yet\nas we shall soon see, easy for humans.\n4.3 Obtaining high human agreement\nHow well can humans distinguish human-written\nendings from machine generations re\ufb01ned with\nAdversarial Filtering? In Figure 6, we com-\npare human performance with that of BERT on\na random 80% \/20% split. We see a contrast\nbetween the ActivityNet and WikiHow perfor-\nmance. While ActivityNet starts o \u000bharder for\nBERT (25.5%), it also proves di \u000ecult for humans\n(60%). In contrast, WikiHow starts easier for\nBERT (41.1%) and humans \ufb01nd the domain al-\nmost trivial (93.5%). We hypothesis this discrep-\nancy is due to the lengths of both datasets (Fig-\nure 7). WikiHow\u2019s 2-sentence generations average\n41 tokens, versus 13 for ActivityNet. This gives\nWikiHow generations three times as many oppor-\ntunities to make a detectable mistake.\nTo ensure high agreement on ActivityNet, we\nperform several rounds of human \ufb01ltering, in-\n0 1 2255075100Accuracy (%)\n25.548.457.160.085.094.0ActivityNet\n0 1 2\n41.145.4 46.093.595.5 96.5WikiHow\nHuman\nBERT\nNumber of annotators during validationFigure 6: For HellaSwag , we ensure high human agree-\nment through several rounds of annotation.

During hu-\nman validation, crowd workers are given a context\nand six ending choices, of which one is the true\nending, and the other \ufb01ve are from AF. On each\niteration, we replace machine-written endings that\nthe worker rated as realistic with new samples. In\nthe end, we keep the 25k best ActivityNet contexts\n(i.e. those with highest agreement among workers\n8) and the 45k best WikiHow contexts.\n4.4 Zero-shot categories for evaluation\nTo evaluate a model\u2019s ability to generalize to new\nsituations, we use category labels from WikiHow\nand ActivityNet to make \u2018zero-shot\u2019 evaluation\nsets. For each set (validation or test), we craft two\nsubsets: one containing 5k \u2018in-domain\u2019 examples\nthat come from categories as seen during training\n(Figure 8), and another with 5k \u2018zero-shot\u2019 exam-\nples from randomly chosen held-out categories. In\ntotal, there are 70k dataset examples.\n8See the appendix for details about how we estimate this.\n5\nOverall In-Domain Zero-Shot ActivityNet WikiHow\nModel Val Test Val Test Val Test Val Test Val Test\nSplit Size \u00d1 10K 10K 5K 5K 5K 5K 3.2K 3.5K 6.8K 6.5K\nChance 25.0\nfastText 30.9 31.6 33.8 32.9 28.0 30.2 27.7 28.4 32.4 33.3\nLSTM +GloVe 31.9 31.7 34.3 32.9 29.5 30.4 34.3 33.8 30.7 30.5\nLSTM +ELMo 31.7 31.4 33.2 32.8 30.4 30.0 33.8 33.3 30.8 30.4\nLSTM +BERT-Base 35.9 36.2 38.7 38.2 33.2 34.1 40.5 40.5 33.7 33.8\nESIM +ELMo 33.6 33.3 35.7 34.2 31.5 32.3 37.7 36.6 31.6 31.5\nOpenAI GPT 41.9 41.7 45.3 44.0 38.6 39.3 46.4 43.8 39.8 40.5\nBERT-Base 39.5 40.5 42.9 42.8 36.1 38.3 48.9 45.7 34.9 37.7\nBERT-Large 46.7 47.3 50.2 49.7 43.3 45.0 54.7 51.7 42.9 45.0\nHuman 95.7 95.6 95.6 95.6 95.8 95.7 94.0 94.0 96.5 96.5\nTable 1: Performance of models, evaluated with accuracy (%).We report results on the full validation and test sets\n(Overall), as well as results on informative subsets of the data: evaluated on in-domain, versus zero-shot situations,\nalong with performance on the underlying data sources (ActivityNet versus WikiHow). All models substantially\nunderperform humans: the gap is over 45% on in-domain categories, and 50% on zero-shot categories.\nFigure 8: Examples on the in-domain validation set of\nHellaSwag , grouped by category label. Our evaluation\nsetup equally weights performance on categories seen\nduring training as well as out-of-domain.\n5 Results\nWe evaluate the di \u000eculty of HellaSwag using a va-\nriety of strong baselines, with and without mas-\nsive pretraining. The models share the same for-\nmat: given a context and an ending, return a logit\nfor that ending. Accordingly, we train our models\nusing a four-way cross-entropy loss, where the ob-\njective is to predict the correct ending. In addition\nto BERT-Large, our comparisons include:\na.OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018): A \ufb01ne-\ntuned 12-layer transformer that was pre-trained on\nthe BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015).\nb.Bert-Base : A smaller version of the BERT\nmodel whose architecture size matches GPT.\nc.ESIM +ELMo (Chen et al., 2017; Peters et al.,\n2018): This is the best-performing ELMo model\nfor NLI, modi\ufb01ed slightly so the \ufb01nal output layeris now a four-way softmax over endings.\nd.LSTM sentence encoder : This is a randomly\ninitialized two-layer bi-LSTM; the second layer\u2019s\nhidden states are max-pooled and fed into an MLP\nto predict the logit.

Surprisingly, despite BERT-\nLarge having been used as the adversarial \ufb01lter,\nit still performs the strongest at 47.3% overall.\nBy making the dataset adversarial for BERT, it\nseems to also have become adversarial for every\nother model. For instance, while ESIM +ELMo\nobtained 59% accuracy on SWAG, it obtains only\n33.3% accuracy on HellaSwag .\nIn addition to pretraining being critical, so too is\nend-to-end \ufb01netuning. Freezing BERT-Base and\nadding an LSTM on top lowers its overall perfor-\nmance 4.3%. This may help explain why mod-\nels such as ESIM +ELMo struggled on SWAG, as\nELMo isn\u2019t updated during \ufb01netuning.\nWhile BERT is the best model, it still struggles\nonHellaSwag , and especially so on zero-shot cat-\n9For ELMo and BERT-Base, the model learns scalar\nweights to combine each internal layer of the encoder.\n10This model is trained with binary cross entropy loss.\n6\nOverall LSMDC ActivityNet30405060708090100 BERT-Large Accuracy (%)86.7%85.5%88.0%\n71.4%69.0%74.2%Evaluated on SWAG\nOverall WikiHow ActivityNet34.6%\n28.0%48.4%46.4%\n42.9%53.7%Evaluated on HellaSwag\nTrained on...\nSWAG\nHellaSwagFigure 9: Transfer experiments from SWAG to Hella-\nSwag and vice versa, evaluated on the validation sets.\nOverall, a BERT-Large that is trained on SWAG hardly\ngeneralizes to HellaSwag : it scores 34.6%.\negories. Performance drops roughly 5% on the\ntest fold, which suggests that the \ufb01netuning is not\nenough for BERT to learn to generalize to novel\nactivities or how-to categories.\nLast, we see that WikiHow is a much harder do-\nmain that ActivityNet for machines: 45% Bert-\nLarge performance, versus 96.5% for humans.\nCuriously, it is on this source dataset that we see\nthe smallest gap between OpenAI GPT and BERT.\nIn fact, OpenAI GPT outperforms BERT on Wiki-\nHow, but the reverse is true for ActivityNet. One\npossibility is that the left-to-right structure of GPT\nis the right inductive bias for WikiHow - perhaps\nreasoning bidirectionally over long contexts is too\nmuch for a 12-layer transformer to learn.\n5.1 SWAG to HellaSwag transfer\nGiven the shared goals and partial domains of\nSWAG and HellaSwag , it is natural to ask to\nwhat extent models can transfer between the two\ndatasets. In Figure 9 we show the results from\ntransfer experiments: models are trained on one\ndataset and evaluated on the other.11\nThe best models are trained on the same\ndataset that they are evaluated on: training on\nSWAG and evaluating on HellaSwag lowers per-\nformance by 12%; vice versa lowers performance\nby 15%. The missing domain for HellaSwag mod-\nels is movie descriptions (LSMDC), still, Hella-\nSwag models obtain 69% accuracy. On the other\nhand, SWAG models do not generalize at all to\ntheir missing domain, WikiHow (28%), suggest-\ning that learning general commonsense reasoning\n11Note that the ActivityNet splits are di \u000berent for each\ndataset. To avoid skewing the results, we report only on\nthe validation video captions that are not in the training sets\nof either dataset. The overall accuracy is then a weighted\naverage, where ActivityNet examples are weighted propor-\ntionately more. This gives a slight advantage to training on\nSWAG, as it sees all the ActivityNet categories when training.Category : Shaving (ActivityNet; In-domain)\nA bearded man is seen speaking to the camera and making several\nfaces. the man\na) then switches o \u000band shows himself via the washer and dryer\nrolling down a towel and scrubbing the \ufb02oor.

The results sug-\ngest that using a a stronger model at test time (over the\nmodel used for AF) improves performance, but is not\nenough to solve the task.\n6 Discussion\nOur results suggest that HellaSwag is a challenging\ntestbed for state-of-the-art NLI models, even those\nbuilt on extensive pretraining. The question still\nremains, though, of where will the \ufb01eld go next?\n6.1 How easy might HellaSwag be for future\ndiscriminators?\nIn this paper, we showed the existence of a\nGoldilocks zone of text complexity \u2013 in which\ngenerations are nonsensical, but existing state-\nof-the-art NLP models cannot tell the di \u000berence.\nHow hard will the dataset be for future, even more\npowerful, models?\nAnswering this question is challenging because\nthese models don\u2019t exist (or are unavailable) at\nthe time of writing . However, one remedy is to\nperform an ablation study on the Adversarial Fil-\ntering model used, comparing weaker \ufb01lters with\nstronger discriminators. We present our results\nin Figure 11, and \ufb01nd that while weak discrim-\ninators (like the stylistic ensemble used to make\nSWAG) only marginally reduce the accuracy of\nBERT-Large, increasing the gap between the \ufb01lter\nand the \ufb01nal discriminator is not enough to solve\nthe task. For instance, using a discriminator with\n3x the parameters as the adversarial \ufb01lter (BERT-\nLarge vs. BERT-Base) results in 63% machine ac-\ncuracy.\n30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nOverall Accuracy on HellaSwag1021041061081010Pretraining Hours (Estimate)\nHuman performance?\nELMoGPTBERT-BaseBERT-LargeFigure 12: Estimated pretraining hours required to\nreach a desired accuracy on HellaSwag . We estimate\nperfomance with respect to a RTX 2080 Ti - a modern,\nfast GPU, and \ufb01t a log-linear regression line. An ex-\ntrapolation suggests that to reach human-level perfor-\nmance on HellaSwag , without algorithmic or computa-\ntional improvements, would require 109GPU-hours of\npretraining (over 100k GPU years).\n6.2 How well does pretraining scale?\nOverall, the current paradigm of pretraining large\nmodels on lots of data has made immense progress\non NLP benchmarks. Though we expect this\ntrend to continue, it also behooves us to con-\nsider its limits. If more compute is indeed the\nanswer for human-level commonsense inference,\nwhat would the compute requirements of this hy-\npothetical massive model look like?\nWe investigate this in Figure 12 by compar-\ning the accuracies of known models on Hella-\nSwag with their computational needs. This estima-\ntion is a rough estimate: we convert reported TPU\nruntimes to our benchmark RTX 2080 Ti GPU us-\ning the Roo\ufb02ine model (Williams et al., 2009),\nwhich focuses primarily on the bottleneck of load-\ning tensors into GPU memory. Extrapolating from\nan exponential \ufb01t suggests that reaching human-\nlevel performance on our dataset would require\n109GPU hours, or 100k years \u2013 unless algorith-\nmic improvements are made.\nWhat might these algorithmic improvements\nlook like? These could include architectural ad-\nvances, better pretraining objectives, and beyond.\nHowever, these improvements share the bottle-\nneck of the data source. To answer some Hella-\nSwag questions correctly without reasoning deeply\n\u2013 like knowing that it is a bad idea to stop at a\nred light for \u2018at most two seconds\u2019 \u2013 might require\nan exponential number of samples, due to prob-\n8\nlems of reporting bias (Gordon and Van Durme,\n2013). Alternatively, future models might answer\ncorrectly only by picking up on spurious patterns,\nin which case a new development of the bench-\nmark \u2013 using these models as adversaries \u2013 would\nplace us in the same position as we are right now.\nPut another way, for humans to answer Hella-\nSwag questions requires abstracting away from\nlanguage and modeling world states instead. We\npostulate that this is what separates solving the\ntask of commonsense NLI, as opposed to a par-\nticular dataset. Indeed, we \ufb01nd that existing deep\nmethods often get fooled by lexical false friends.\nFor example, in the WikiHow example from Fig-\nure 10, BERT chooses an ending that matches\nthetechnology words in the context, rather than\nmatching the deeper topic: using technology as an\nexcuse for not doing homework.\n6.3 Towards a future of evolving benchmarks\nWhat happens when HellaSwag gets solved? We\nbelieve the answer is simple: crowdsource another\ndataset, with the same exact format, and see where\nmodels fail. Indeed, in our work we found this to\nbe straightforward from an algorithmic perspec-\ntive: by throwing in the best known generator\n(GPT) and the best known discriminator (BERT-\nLarge), we made a dataset that is adversarial - not\njust to BERT, but to all models we have access to.\nWhile this was easy algorithmically, care must\nbe taken from a data curation standpoint. Indeed,\nwe \ufb01nd success exists within a Goldilocks zone:\nthe data source must be complex enough that state-\nof-the-art generators often make mistakes, while\nsimple enough such that discriminators often fail\nto catch them. This ties the future of SWAG-\nstyle benchmarks to progress on language gener-\nation: until generation is solved, commonsense\nNLI will remain unsolved. Even recent promis-\ning results on scaling up language models (Rad-\nford et al., 2019) \ufb01nd problems in terms of consis-\ntency, with the best curated examples requiring 25\nrandom seeds.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we presented HellaSwag , a new\ndataset for physically situated commonsense rea-\nsoning. By constructing the dataset through ad-\nversarial \ufb01ltering, combined with state-of-the-art\nmodels for language generation and discrimina-\ntion, we produced a dataset that is adversarial tothe most robust models available \u2013 even when\nmodels are evaluated on items from the train-\ning distribution. In turn, we provided insight\ninto the inner workings of pretrained models, and\nsuggest a path for NLP progress going forward:\ntowards benchmarks that adversarially co-evolve\nwith evolving state-of-the-art models.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the reviewers, as well as Jesse Thoma-\nson, for their helpful feedback.

Our\nsmaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its\ncapabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a\ncomparative on-device study.\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released\npretrained language models.The last two years have seen the rise\nof Transfer Learning approaches in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nwith large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels becoming a basic tool in\nmany NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2018,\nRadford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019].\nWhile these models lead to signi\ufb01-\ncant improvement, they often have\nseveral hundred million parameters\nand current research1on pre-trained\nmodels indicates that training even\nlarger models still leads to better per-\nformances on downstream tasks.\nThe trend toward bigger models\nraises several concerns. First is the\nenvironmental cost of exponentially scaling these models\u2019 computational requirements as mentioned\nin Schwartz et al. [2019], Strubell et al. [2019]. Second, while operating these models on-device\nin real-time has the potential to enable novel and interesting language processing applications, the\ngrowing computational and memory requirements of these models may hamper wide adoption.\n1See for instance the recently released MegatronLM\nEMC^2: 5th Edition Co-located with NeurIPS\u201919arXiv:1910.01108v4  [cs.CL]  1 Mar 2020\nIn this paper, we show that it is possible to reach similar performances on many downstream-tasks\nusing much smaller language models pre-trained with knowledge distillation, resulting in models\nthat are lighter and faster at inference time, while also requiring a smaller computational training\nbudget. Our general-purpose pre-trained models can be \ufb01ne-tuned with good performances on several\ndownstream tasks, keeping the \ufb02exibility of larger models. We also show that our compressed models\nare small enough to run on the edge, e.g. on mobile devices.\nUsing a triple loss, we show that a 40% smaller Transformer (Vaswani et al. [2017]) pre-trained\nthrough distillation via the supervision of a bigger Transformer language model can achieve similar\nperformance on a variety of downstream tasks, while being 60% faster at inference time. Further\nablation studies indicate that all the components of the triple loss are important for best performances.\nWe have made the trained weights available along with the training code in the Transformers2\nlibrary from HuggingFace [Wolf et al., 2019].\n2 Knowledge distillation\nKnowledge distillation [Bucila et al., 2006, Hinton et al., 2015] is a compression technique in which\na compact model - the student - is trained to reproduce the behaviour of a larger model - the teacher -\nor an ensemble of models.\nIn supervised learning, a classi\ufb01cation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model\u2019s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\nclasses. But some of these \"near-zero\" probabilities are larger than others and re\ufb02ect, in part, the\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\nthe teacher: Lce=P\niti\u0003log(si)where ti(resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\n(resp. the student). This objective results in a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher\ndistribution. Following Hinton et al. [2015] we used a softmax-temperature :pi=exp(zi=T)P\njexp(zj=T)\nwhere Tcontrols the smoothness of the output distribution and ziis the model score for the class i.\nThe same temperature Tis applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference,\nTis set to 1 to recover a standard softmax .\nThe \ufb01nal training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss Lcewith the supervised\ntraining loss, in our case the masked language modeling lossLmlm [Devlin et al., 2018]. We found it\nbene\ufb01cial to add a cosine embedding loss (Lcos) which will tend to align the directions of the student\nand teacher hidden states vectors.\n3 DistilBERT: a distilled version of BERT\nStudent architecture In the present work, the student - DistilBERT - has the same general architec-\nture as BERT. The token-type embeddings and the pooler are removed while the number of layers\nis reduced by a factor of 2. Most of the operations used in the Transformer architecture ( linear\nlayer andlayer normalisation ) are highly optimized in modern linear algebra frameworks and our\ninvestigations showed that variations on the last dimension of the tensor (hidden size dimension) have\na smaller impact on computation ef\ufb01ciency (for a \ufb01xed parameters budget) than variations on other\nfactors like the number of layers. Thus we focus on reducing the number of layers.\nStudent initialization In addition to the previously described optimization and architectural choices,\nan important element in our training procedure is to \ufb01nd the right initialization for the sub-network to\nconverge. Taking advantage of the common dimensionality between teacher and student networks,\nwe initialize the student from the teacher by taking one layer out of two.\n3E.g. BERT-base\u2019s predictions for a masked token in \" I think this is the beginning of a\nbeautiful [MASK] \" comprise two high probability tokens ( dayandlife) and a long tail of valid predictions\n(future ,story ,world . . . ).\n2\nTable 1: DistilBERT retains 97% of BERT performance.

[2019].\nAs such, DistilBERT is distilled on very large batches leveraging gradient accumulation (up to 4K\nexamples per batch) using dynamic masking and without the next sentence prediction objective.\nData and compute power We train DistilBERT on the same corpus as the original BERT model:\na concatenation of English Wikipedia and Toronto Book Corpus [Zhu et al., 2015]. DistilBERT\nwas trained on 8 16GB V100 GPUs for approximately 90 hours. For the sake of comparison, the\nRoBERTa model [Liu et al., 2019] required 1 day of training on 1024 32GB V100.\n4 Experiments\nGeneral Language Understanding We assess the language understanding and generalization ca-\npabilities of DistilBERT on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark\n[Wang et al., 2018], a collection of 9 datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems.\nWe report scores on the development sets for each task by \ufb01ne-tuning DistilBERT without the use\nof ensembling or multi-tasking scheme for \ufb01ne-tuning (which are mostly orthogonal to the present\nwork). We compare the results to the baseline provided by the authors of GLUE: an ELMo (Peters\net al. [2018]) encoder followed by two BiLSTMs.4\nThe results on each of the 9 tasks are showed on Table 1 along with the macro-score (average of\nindividual scores). Among the 9 tasks, DistilBERT is always on par or improving over the ELMo\nbaseline (up to 19 points of accuracy on STS-B). DistilBERT also compares surprisingly well to\nBERT, retaining 97% of the performance with 40% fewer parameters.\n4.1 Downstream task benchmark\nDownstream tasks We further study the performances of DistilBERT on several downstream tasks\nunder ef\ufb01cient inference constraints: a classi\ufb01cation task (IMDb sentiment classi\ufb01cation - Maas et al.\n[2011]) and a question answering task (SQuAD v1.1 - Rajpurkar et al. [2016]).\nAs shown in Table 2, DistilBERT is only 0.6% point behind BERT in test accuracy on the IMDb\nbenchmark while being 40% smaller. On SQuAD, DistilBERT is within 3.9 points of the full BERT.\nWe also studied whether we could add another step of distillation during the adaptation phase by\n\ufb01ne-tuning DistilBERT on SQuAD using a BERT model previously \ufb01ne-tuned on SQuAD as a\n3\nTable 4: Ablation study. Variations are relative to the model trained with triple loss and teacher\nweights initialization.\nAblation Variation on GLUE macro-score\n;-Lcos-Lmlm -2.96\nLce-;-Lmlm -1.46\nLce-Lcos-; -0.31\nTriple loss + random weights initialization -3.69\nteacher for an additional term in the loss (knowledge distillation). In this setting, there are thus two\nsuccessive steps of distillation, one during the pre-training phase and one during the adaptation phase.\nIn this case, we were able to reach interesting performances given the size of the model: 79.8 F1 and\n70.4 EM, i.e. within 3 points of the full model.\nSize and inference speed\nTo further investigate the speed-up\/size trade-off of DistilBERT, we compare (in Table 3) the number\nof parameters of each model along with the inference time needed to do a full pass on the STS-\nB development set on CPU (Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 Haswell @2.9GHz) using a batch size of 1.\nDistilBERT has 40% fewer parameters than BERT and is 60% faster than BERT.\nOn device computation We studied whether DistilBERT could be used for on-the-edge applications\nby building a mobile application for question answering. We compare the average inference time on\na recent smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) against our previously trained question answering model based\non BERT-base. Excluding the tokenization step, DistilBERT is 71% faster than BERT, and the whole\nmodel weighs 207 MB (which could be further reduced with quantization). Our code is available5.\n4.2 Ablation study\nIn this section, we investigate the in\ufb02uence of various components of the triple loss and the student\ninitialization on the performances of the distilled model. We report the macro-score on GLUE. Table 4\npresents the deltas with the full triple loss: removing the Masked Language Modeling loss has little\nimpact while the two distillation losses account for a large portion of the performance.\n5 Related work\nTask-speci\ufb01c distillation Most of the prior works focus on building task-speci\ufb01c distillation se-\ntups. Tang et al. [2019] transfer \ufb01ne-tune classi\ufb01cation model BERT to an LSTM-based classi\ufb01er.\nChatterjee [2019] distill BERT model \ufb01ne-tuned on SQuAD in a smaller Transformer model previ-\nously initialized from BERT. In the present work, we found it bene\ufb01cial to use a general-purpose\npre-training distillation rather than a task-speci\ufb01c distillation. Turc et al. [2019] use the original\npretraining objective to train smaller student, then \ufb01ne-tuned via distillation. As shown in the abla-\ntion study, we found it bene\ufb01cial to leverage the teacher\u2019s knowledge to pre-train with additional\ndistillation signal.\nMulti-distillation Yang et al. [2019] combine the knowledge of an ensemble of teachers using\nmulti-task learning to regularize the distillation. The authors apply Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation\nto learn a compact question answering model from a set of large question answering models. An\napplication of multi-distillation is multi-linguality: Tsai et al. [2019] adopts a similar approach to us\nby pre-training a multilingual model from scratch solely through distillation. However, as shown in\nthe ablation study, leveraging the teacher\u2019s knowledge with initialization and additional losses leads\nto substantial gains.\nOther compression techniques have been studied to compress large models. Recent developments\nin weights pruning reveal that it is possible to remove some heads in the self-attention at test time\nwithout signi\ufb01cantly degrading the performance Michel et al. [2019]. Some layers can be reduced\nto one head. A separate line of study leverages quantization to derive smaller models (Gupta et al.\n[2015]). Pruning and quantization are orthogonal to the present work.\nConclusion and future work\nWe introduced DistilBERT, a general-purpose pre-trained version of BERT, 40% smaller, 60% faster,\nthat retains 97% of the language understanding capabilities. We showed that a general-purpose\nlanguage model can be successfully trained with distillation and analyzed the various components\nwith an ablation study. We further demonstrated that DistilBERT is a compelling option for edge\napplications.","references":[{"id":"1910.01108"}]},{"id":"2009.03300","title":"Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding","summary":"We propose a new test to measure a text model's multitask accuracy.

However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more dif\ufb01cult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\n57subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in dif\ufb01culty from\nan elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem\nsolving ability. Subjects range from traditional areas, such as mathematics and history, to more\n1arXiv:2009.03300v3  [cs.CY]  12 Jan 2021\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nFew Shot Prompt and Predicted Answer\nHow many numbers are in the list 25, 26, ..., 100?\n(A) 75 (B) 76 (C) 22 (D) 23\nAnswer: B\nCompute i+i2+i3+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+i258+i259.\n(A) -1 (B) 1 (C) i (D) -i\nAnswer: A\nIf 4 daps = 7 yaps, and 5 yaps = 3 baps,\nhow many daps equal 42 baps?\n(A) 28 (B) 21 (C) 40 (D) 30\nAnswer: C\u2423The following are multiple choice questions\nabout high school mathematics.\n(a) An example of few-shot learning and inference us-\ning GPT-3.

The granularity and breadth of the\nsubjects makes the benchmark ideal for identifying a model\u2019s blind spots.\nWe \ufb01nd that meaningful progress on our benchmark has only become possible in recent months. In\nparticular, few-shot models up to 13billion parameters (Brown et al., 2020) achieve random chance\nperformance of 25% accuracy, but the 175billion parameter GPT-3 model reaches a much higher\n43:9%accuracy (see Figure 1b). On the other hand, unlike human professionals GPT-3 does not\nexcel at any single subject. Instead, we \ufb01nd that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost\n70% accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.\nOur results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-of-the-art models still\nstruggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining. The tasks with near-random accuracy\ninclude calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human\nvalues such as law and morality. This second weakness is particularly concerning because it will\nbe important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical.\nWorryingly, we also \ufb01nd that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know\nsince its average con\ufb01dence can be up to 24% off from its actual accuracy. We comprehensively\nevaluate the breadth and depth of a model\u2019s text understanding by covering numerous topics that\nhumans are incentivized to learn. Since our test consists in 57tasks, it can be used to analyze\naggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings. The test and code is\navailable at github.com\/hendrycks\/test.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nPretraining. The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora\nincluding educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information\nabout a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information\nfrom pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively\nmeasured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used \ufb01ne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).\nHowever, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) have made it possible to achieve\ncompetitive performance without \ufb01ne-tuning by using few-shot learning, which removes the need for\na large \ufb01ne-tuning set. With the advent of strong zero-shot and few-shot learning, it is now possible\nto curate a diverse set of tasks for evaluation and remove the possibility of models on \u201cspurious cues\u201d\n(Geirhos et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2019b) in a dataset to achieve high performance.\nBenchmarks. Many recent benchmarks aim to assess a model\u2019s general world knowledge and basic\nreasoning ability by testing its \u201ccommonsense.\u201d A number of commonsense benchmarks have been\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nAs Seller, an encyclopedia salesman, approached the grounds on which Hermit's house was situated,\nhe saw a sign that said, \"No salesmen.

By design, these datasets assess abilities that almost every child has. In contrast,\nwe include harder specialized subjects that people must study to learn.\nSome researchers have suggested that the future of NLP evaluation should focus on Natural Language\nGeneration (NLG) (Zellers et al., 2020), an idea that reaches back to the Turing Test (Turing, 1950).\nHowever, NLG is notoriously dif\ufb01cult to evaluate and lacks a standard metric (Sai et al., 2020).\nConsequently, we instead create a simple-to-evaluate test that measures classi\ufb01cation accuracy on\nmultiple choice questions.\nWhile several question answering benchmarks exist, they are comparatively limited in scope. Most\neither cover easy topics like grade school subjects for which models can already achieve strong\nperformance (Clark et al., 2018; Khot et al., 2019; Mihaylov et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2019), or\nare focused on linguistic understanding in the form of reading comprehension (Lai et al., 2017;\nRichardson et al., 2013). In contrast, we include a wide range of dif\ufb01cult subjects that go far beyond\nlinguistic understanding.\n3 A M ULTITASK TEST\nWe create a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of\nknowledge. The test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas\nthat are important for some people to learn. There are 57tasks in total, which is also the number\nof Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013), all of which are listed in Appendix B. The questions in\nthe dataset were manually collected by graduate and undergraduate students from freely available\nsources online. These include practice questions for tests such as the Graduate Record Examination\nand the United States Medical Licensing Examination. It also includes questions designed for\nundergraduate courses and questions designed for readers of Oxford University Press books. Some\ntasks cover a subject, like psychology, but at a speci\ufb01c level of dif\ufb01culty, such as \u201cElementary,\u201d\n\u201cHigh School,\u201d \u201cCollege,\u201d or \u201cProfessional.\u201d For example, the \u201cProfessional Psychology\u201d task draws\non questions from freely available practice questions for the Examination for Professional Practice\nin Psychology, while the \u201cHigh School Psychology\u201d task has questions like those from Advanced\nPlacement Psychology examinations.\nWe collected 15908 questions in total, which we split into a few-shot development set, a validation\nset, and a test set. The few-shot development set has 5questions per subject, the validation set may\nbe used for selecting hyperparameters and is made of 1540 questions, and the test set has 14079\nquestions. Each subject contains 100test examples at the minimum, which is longer than most exams\ndesigned to assess people.\nHuman-level accuracy on this test varies. Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk\nobtain 34:5%accuracy on this test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For\nexample, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around 87% for US Medical\nLicensing Examinations, and these questions make up our \u201cProfessional Medicine\u201d task. If we take\nthe 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an\neducated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is\napproximately 89:8%.\nSince our test aggregates different subjects and several levels of dif\ufb01culty, we measure more than\nstraightforward commonsense or narrow linguistic understanding. Instead, we measure arbitrary\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nOne of the reasons that the government discourages and regulates monopolies is that\n(A) producer surplus is lost and consumer surplus is gained.\n(B) monopoly prices ensure productive efficiency but cost society allocative efficiency.\n(C) monopoly firms do not engage in significant research and development.\n(D) consumer surplus is lost with higher prices and lower levels of output.Microeconomics\nFigure 3: Examples from the Microeconomics task.\nWhen you drop a ball from rest it accelerates downward at 9.8 m\/s\u00b2.

To succeed at our test, future models should be\nwell-rounded, possess extensive world knowledge, and develop expert-level problem solving ability.\nThese properties make the test likely to be an enduring and informative goalpost.\n3.1 H UMANITIES\nThe humanities is a group of disciplines that make use of qualitative analysis and analytic methods\nrather than scienti\ufb01c empirical methods. Branches of the humanities include law, philosophy, history,\nand so on (Appendix B). Mastering these subjects requires a variety of skills. For example, legal\nunderstanding requires knowledge of how to apply rules and standards to complex scenarios, and\nalso provide answers with stipulations and explanations. We illustrate this in Figure 2. Legal\nunderstanding is also necessary for understanding and following rules and regulations, a necessary\ncapability to constrain open-world machine learning models. For philosophy, our questions cover\nconcepts like logical fallacies, formal logic, and famous philosophical arguments. It also covers\nmoral scenarios, including questions from the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2020) that test a\nmodel\u2019s understanding of normative statements through predicting widespread moral intuitions about\ndiverse everyday scenarios. Finally, our history questions cover a wide range of time periods and\ngeographical locations, including prehistory and other advanced subjects.\n3.2 S OCIAL SCIENCE\nSocial science includes branches of knowledge that examine human behavior and society. Subject\nareas include economics, sociology, politics, geography, psychology, and so on. See Figure 3 for\nan example question. Our economics questions include microeconomics, macroeconomics, and\neconometrics, and cover different types of problems, including questions that require a mixture of\nworld knowledge, qualitative reasoning, or quantitative reasoning. We also include important but\nmore esoteric topics such as security studies in order to test the boundaries of what is experienced and\nlearned during pretraining. Social science also includes psychology, a \ufb01eld that may be especially\nimportant for attaining a nuanced understanding of humans.\n3.3 S CIENCE , TECHNOLOGY , ENGINEERING ,AND MATHEMATICS (STEM)\nSTEM subjects include physics, computer science, mathematics, and more. Two examples are shown\nin Figure 4. Conceptual physics tests understanding of simple physics principles and may be thought\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nA 33-year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer.

We\nalso test mathematical problem solving ability at various levels of dif\ufb01culty, from the elementary to\nthe college level. College mathematics questions, like those found on the GRE mathematics subject\ntest, often require chains of reasoning and abstract knowledge. To encode mathematics expressions,\nwe use LaTeX or symbols such as * and \u02c6 for multiplication and exponentiation respectively. STEM\nsubjects require knowledge of empirical methods, \ufb02uid intelligence, and procedural knowledge.\n3.4 O THER\nThere is a long tail of subjects that either do not neatly \ufb01t into any of the three preceding categories or\nfor which there are not thousands of freely available questions. We put these subjects into Other. This\nsection includes the Professional Medicine task, which has dif\ufb01cult questions that require humans\nmany years of study to master. An example is depicted in Figure 5. This section also contains\nbusiness topics like \ufb01nance, accounting, and marketing, as well as knowledge of global facts. The\nlatter includes statistics about poverty in different countries over time, which may be necessary for\nhaving an accurate model of the world internationally.\n4 E XPERIMENTS\n4.1 S ETUP\nAssessment and Models. To measure performance on our multitask test, we compute the clas-\nsi\ufb01cation accuracy across all examples and tasks. We evaluate GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and\nUni\ufb01edQA (Khashabi et al., 2020). For GPT-3 we use the OpenAI API, which provides access to four\nmodel variants, \u201cAda,\u201d \u201cBabbage,\u201d \u201cCurie,\u201d and \u201cDavinci,\u201d which we refer to as \u201cSmall\u201d ( 2:7billion\nparameters), \u201cMedium\u201d ( 6:7billion), \u201cLarge\u201d ( 13billion) and \u201cX-Large\u201d ( 175billion). Uni\ufb01edQA\nuses the T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) text-to-text backbone and is \ufb01ne-tuned on previously proposed\nquestion answering datasets (Lai et al., 2017), where the prediction is the class with the highest\ntoken overlap with Uni\ufb01edQA\u2019s text output. Since Uni\ufb01edQA is \ufb01ne-tuned on other datasets, we\nevaluate it without any further tuning to assess its transfer accuracy. We also \ufb01ne-tune RoBERTa-base,\nALBERT-xxlarge, and GPT-2 on Uni\ufb01edQA training data and our dev+val set. We primarily focus on\nUni\ufb01edQA and GPT-3 in the rest of this document, but additional discussion of RoBERTa, ALBERT,\nand GPT-2 is in Appendix A.\nModel Humanities Social Science STEM Other Average\nRandom Baseline 25.0 25.0 25.0 25.0 25.0\nRoBERTa 27.9 28.8 27.0 27.7 27.9\nALBERT 27.2 25.7 27.7 27.9 27.1\nGPT-2 32.8 33.3 30.2 33.1 32.4\nUni\ufb01edQA 45.6 56.6 40.2 54.6 48.9\nGPT-3 Small (few-shot) 24.4 30.9 26.0 24.1 25.9\nGPT-3 Medium (few-shot) 26.1 21.6 25.6 25.5 24.9\nGPT-3 Large (few-shot) 27.1 25.6 24.3 26.5 26.0\nGPT-3 X-Large (few-shot) 40.8 50.4 36.7 48.8 43.9\nTable 1: Average weighted accuracy for each model on all four broad disciplines.

We feed GPT-3 prompts\nlike that shown in Figure 1a. We begin each\nprompt with \u201cThe following are multiple choice\nquestions (with answers) about [subject].\u201d For\nzero-shot evaluation, we append the question to\nthe prompt. For few-shot evaluation, we add up\nto5demonstration examples with answers to\nthe prompt before appending the question. All\nprompts end with \u201cAnswer: \u201d. The model then\nproduces probabilities for the tokens \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d\n\u201cC,\u201d and \u201cD,\u201d and we treat the highest probability\noption as the prediction. For consistent evalua-\ntion, we create a dev set with 5\ufb01xed few-shot\nexamples for each subject.\n4.2 R ESULTS\nModel Size and Accuracy. We compare the\nfew-shot accuracy of each GPT-3 size in Table 1.\nWe \ufb01nd that the three smaller GPT-3 models\nhave near random accuracy (around 25%). In\ncontrast, we \ufb01nd that the X-Large 175billion\nparameter GPT-3 model performs substantially\nbetter than random, with an accuracy of 43:9%.\nWe also \ufb01nd qualitatively similar results in the\nzero-shot setting. While the smaller models\nhave around 25% zero-shot accuracy, Figure 10\nin Appendix A shows that the largest GPT-3\nmodel has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of\nabout 37:7%. Brown et al. (2020) also observe\nthat larger GPT-3 models perform better, though\nprogress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we\nshow that non-random accuracy on the multitask\ntest emerged with recent large few-shot models\ncompared to datasets that assess commonsense\nand linguistic understanding.\nTo test the usefulness of \ufb01ne-tuning instead of\nfew-shot learning, we also evaluate Uni\ufb01edQA\nmodels. Uni\ufb01edQA has the advantage of being\n\ufb01ne-tuned on other question answering datasets,\nunlike GPT-3. We assess Uni\ufb01edQA by evalu-\nating its transfer performance without any ad-\nditional \ufb01ne-tuning. The largest Uni\ufb01edQA\nmodel we test has 11billion parameters, which\nis slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Neverthe-\nless, we show in Table 1 that it attains 48:9%\naccuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite Uni\ufb01edQA have\nan order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also \ufb01nd that even the smallest Uni\ufb01edQA variant,\nwith just 60million parameters, has approximately 29:3%accuracy. These results suggest that while\nmodel size is a key component for achieving strong performance, \ufb01ne-tuning also helps.\nComparing Disciplines. Using our test, we discover that GPT-3 and Uni\ufb01edQA have lopsided\nperformance and several substantial knowledge gaps. Figure 6 shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (few-\nshot) and Uni\ufb01edQA for all 57tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance\nfor all tasks, with GPT-3\u2019s accuracy ranging from 69% for US Foreign Policy to 26% for College\nChemistry. Uni\ufb01edQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of 82:5%.\nOverall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems. Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy\nSTEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects.

We speculate\nthat is in part because GPT-3 acquires declarative knowledge more readily than procedural knowledge.\nFor example, many questions in Elementary Mathematics require applying the order of operations\nfor arithmetic, which is described by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses Exponents Multiplication\nDivision Addition Subtraction). In Figure 7, we con\ufb01rm that GPT-3 is aware of the acronym\nPEMDAS. However, it does not consistently apply PEMDAS to actual problems. On the other hand,\nprocedural understanding is not its only weak point. We \ufb01nd that some verbal tasks such as Moral\nScenarios from Hendrycks et al. (2020) and Professional Law also have especially low accuracy.\nOur test also shows that GPT-3 acquires knowledge quite unlike humans. For example, GPT-3 learns\nabout topics in a pedagogically unusual order. GPT-3 does better on College Medicine ( 47:4%)\nand College Mathematics ( 35:0%) than calculation-heavy Elementary Mathematics ( 29:9%). GPT-3\ndemonstrates unusual breadth, but it does not master a single subject. Meanhwhile we suspect humans\nhave mastery in several subjects but not as much breadth. In this way, our test shows that GPT-3 has\nmany knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.\nCalibration. We should not trust a model\u2019s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning\nthat its con\ufb01dence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However,\nlarge neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et al., 2017), especially under distribution shift\n(Ovadia et al., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average con\ufb01dence\nestimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates\nthat GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its con\ufb01dence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in\nthe zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and con\ufb01dence reaching up to 24%\nfor some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error\n(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Kumar et al., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as\nElementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only\nsomewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest\nthat model calibration has wide room for improvement.\n5 D ISCUSSION\nMultimodal Understanding. While text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts\nabout the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as\nimages, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et al., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as\nGPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse\narray of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs,\nbenchmarks should be designed to re\ufb02ect this change. One such benchmark could be a \u201cTurk Test,\u201d\nconsisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-de\ufb01ned tasks that\nrequire models to interact with \ufb02exible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\nThe Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask\nNLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have\nacquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nprocess is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the\ndownstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up\nfrom reading the same text.\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how\nhumans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large\nquestion bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk\nabout the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,\nsuch as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum , but there are fewer than 5,000\nmultistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number\nof practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide\na dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be\nused for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to compute the \ufb01nal accuracy. Importantly,\nthe format of our evaluation is not identical to the format in which information is acquired during\npretraining. This has the bene\ufb01t of obviating concerns about spurious training set annotation artifacts\n(Geirhos et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2019b) and is in stark contrast to the previous paradigm\nof identically distributed training and test sets. This change also enables collecting a much more\nextensive and diverse set of tasks for evaluation. We anticipate our methodology becoming more\nwidespread as models improve at extracting information from diverse online sources.\nModel Limitations. We \ufb01nd that current large-scale Transformers have wide room for improvement.\nThey are notably poor at modeling human (dis)approval, as evident by the low performance on the\nProfessional Law and Moral Scenarios tasks. For future systems to be aligned with human values, high\nperformance on these tasks is crucial (Hendrycks et al., 2020), so future research should especially\naim to increase accuracy on these tasks. Models also have dif\ufb01culty performing calculations, so much\nso that they exhibit poor performance on Elementary Mathematics and many other STEM subjects\nwith \u201cplug and chug\u201d problems. Additionally, they do not match expert-level performance (90%) on\nany subject, so for all subjects it is subhuman. On average, models are only now starting to move\nbeyond random-chance accuracy levels.\nAddressing these shortcomings may be challenging. To illustrate this, we attempted to create a better\nProfessional Law model by pretraining on specialized data but achieved only limited success. We\ncollected approximately 2,000 additional Professional Law training examples. After \ufb01ne-tuning a\nRoBERTa-base model (Liu et al., 2019) using this custom training set, our model attained 32:8%test\naccuracy. To test the impact of additional specialized training data, we also had RoBERTa continue\npretraining on approximately 1.6 million legal case summaries using Harvard\u2019s Law Library case law\ncorpus case.law , but after \ufb01ne-tuning it only attained 36:1%accuracy. This suggests that while\nadditional pretraining on relevant high quality text can help, it may not be enough to substantially\nincrease the performance of current models.\nIt is unclear whether simply scaling up existing language models will solve the test. Current\nunderstanding indicates that a 10\u0002increase in model size must be accompanied by an approximate\n5\u0002increase in data (Kaplan et al., 2020). Aside from the tremendous expense in creating multi-trillion\nparameter language models, data may also become a bottleneck, as there is far less written about\nesoteric branches of knowledge than about everyday situations.\n6 C ONCLUSION\nWe introduced a new test that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge\nencountered during pretraining. By covering 57 subjects at varying levels of dif\ufb01culty, the test\nassesses language understanding in greater breadth and depth than previous benchmarks. We found\nthat it has recently become possible for models to make meaningful progress on the test, but that\nstate-of-the-art models have lopsided performance and rarely excel at any individual task. We also\nshowed that current models are uncalibrated and have dif\ufb01culty with tasks that require calculations.\nWorryingly, models also perform especially poorly on socially relevant subjects including morality\nand law. Our expansive test can help researchers pinpoint important shortcomings of models, making\nit easier to gain a clearer picture of state-of-the-art capabilities.\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nADDITIONAL ANALYSIS\nThis appendix includes \ufb01gures with sorted results (Figure 9), few-shot examples vs. accuracy\n(Figure 10), and few-shot calibration (Figure 11).

For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are \ufb01ne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUni\ufb01edQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27:9%, with 27:9%accuracy for the humanities, 28:8%for social sciences,\n27:0%for STEM, and 27:7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27:1%, with 27:2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25:7%for the social sciences, 27:7%for STEM, and 27:9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32:4%, with 32:8%accuracy for the humanities, 33:3%for the social\nsciences, 30:2%for STEM, and 33:1%for other.\nCompare this to Uni\ufb01edQA\u2019s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29:3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUni\ufb01edQA with 3billion parameters attains 43:7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1:5\nbillion parameters attains 32:4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5\u2019s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore Uni\ufb01edQA\u2019s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high con\ufb01dence mistakes. We \ufb01nd that while many of\nthese mistakes were clearly wrong, many were mistakes that a human might make. For example,\none question it got wrong was \u201cHow many chromosomes do all human somatic cells contain?\u201d The\ncorrect answer is 46, while few-shot GPT-3 predicted 23with con\ufb01dence 97:5%. This answer would\nhave been correct if the question asked about the number of pairs of chromosomes. Similarly, many\nof its other high con\ufb01dence mistakes were also correct answers to slightly different questions.\nA.3 F ORMAT SENSITIVITY\nWhile different question formatting choices often lead to similar GPT-3 accuracies, we \ufb01nd that\nUni\ufb01edQA is more sensitive. Uni\ufb01edQA\u2019s input format is of the form\nQUESTION1 \\n (A) CHOICE1 (B) CHOICE2 (C) CHOICE3 (D) CHOICE4<\/s>\nwhere questions and choices are normalized and made lowercase. If we remove the <\/s> from the\ninput, accuracy declines by several percentage points.\n12\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n0-Shot 1-Shot 2-Shot 3-Shot 4-Shot 5-Shot\nNumber of Examples in Context3035404550Accuracy (%)\nGPT-3 Multitask Accuracy vs.\nNumber of Examples in Context\nFigure 10: As the number of few-shot instruction\nexamples increases, the accuracy monotonically\nincreases.

We list all tasks and the topics\nthey test in Table 2.

For questions\nlonger than a tweet (280 characters), the correlation between question length and true label con\ufb01dence\nis slightly positive. This shows that longer questions are not necessarily harder.\nB.2 E XACT QUESTION AND ANSWER CONTAMINATION\nSince language models train on vast text corpora, there is some chance that they have seen the exact\nquestion and answer during pretraining. If they memorized the exact question and answer, then\nthey would attain higher accuracy than their true ability. Likewise, a question\u2019s entropy would be\nespecially low if it were memorized. Memorized questions and answers should have low entropy and\n13\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nhigh accuracy. However, in Figure 13, we see that accuracy and question entropy are not positively\ncorrelated, suggesting that the test\u2019s low-entropy questions do not correspond to memorized (and\nthereby correctly predicted) answers. This suggests that our exact questions were not memorized.\nHowever, during pretraining models encountered text related to our questions through processing\nWikipedia. We also note that most of our questions came from PDFs or websites where questions and\nanswers are on separate pages.\nSee Brown et al. (2020) for a previous discussion of contamination showing that the phenomena\nhardly affects performance. To reduce the probability that future models encounter exact questions\nduring test-time, we will provide a list of question sources.\n2.8\n 2.6\n 2.4\n 2.2\n 2.0\n 1.8\nLog Probability Per Token2030405060Accuracy (%)\nGPT-3 Zero-Shot\nPrompt Compression and Accuracy\n2.4\n 2.2\n 2.0\n 1.8\n 1.6\n 1.4\n 1.2\nLog Probability Per Token203040506070Accuracy (%)\nGPT-3 Few-Shot\nPrompt Compression and Accuracy\nFigure 13: The average log probability of the question (without answer) is not strongly positively\ncorrelated with accuracy, all else equal.

We release\nall our models to the research community1.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\nproperties \ufb01rst appeared when scaling models to a\nsuf\ufb01cient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\n\u0003Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\n1https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/llamaperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we \ufb01nd\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\nresulting models, called LLaMA , ranges from 7B\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\nmarks, despite being 10 \u0002smaller. We believe that\nthis model will help democratize the access and\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\navailable or undocumented (e.g. \u201cBooks \u2013 2TB\u201d or\n\u201cSocial media conversations\u201d). There exist some\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\nof the modi\ufb01cations we made to the transformer\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\nthe responsible AI community.arXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 2023\n2 Approach\nOur training approach is similar to the methods\ndescribed in previous work (Brown et al., 2020;\nChowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the\nChinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\nWe train large transformers on a large quantity of\ntextual data using a standard optimizer.\n2.1 Pre-training Data\nOur training dataset is a mixture of several sources,\nreported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of do-\nmains. For the most part, we reuse data sources\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\ncentage they represent in the training set:\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\n\ufb01ve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\nline level, performs language identi\ufb01cation with\na fastText linear classi\ufb01er to remove non-English\npages and \ufb01lters low quality content with an n-\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\nin Wikipedia v.s.randomly sampled pages, and\ndiscarded pages not classi\ufb01ed as references.\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\nalso contains deduplication and language identi\ufb01-\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\nthe quality \ufb01ltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we \ufb01ltered\nlow quality \ufb01les with heuristics based on the line\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\ning dataset at the \ufb01le level, with exact matches.\nWikipedia [4.5%]. We add Wikipedia dumps\nfrom the June-August 2022 period, covering 20Dataset Sampling prop.

We process the\ndata to remove hyperlinks, comments and other\nformatting boilerplate.\nGutenberg and Books3 [4.5%]. We include\ntwo book corpora in our training dataset: the Guten-\nberg Project, which contains books that are in the\npublic domain, and the Books3 section of TheP-\nile (Gao et al., 2020), a publicly available dataset\nfor training large language models. We perform\ndeduplication at the book level, removing books\nwith more than 90% content overlap.\nArXiv [2.5%]. We process arXiv Latex \ufb01les\nto add scienti\ufb01c data to our dataset. Following\nLewkowycz et al. (2022), we removed everything\nbefore the \ufb01rst section, as well as the bibliography.\nWe also removed the comments from the .tex \ufb01les,\nand inline-expanded de\ufb01nitions and macros written\nby users to increase consistency across papers.\nStack Exchange [2%]. We include a dump of\nStack Exchange, a website of high quality ques-\ntions and answers that covers a diverse set of do-\nmains, ranging from computer science to chemistry.\nWe kept the data from the 28 largest websites, re-\nmoved the HTML tags from text and sorted the\nanswers by score (from highest to lowest).\nTokenizer. We tokenize the data with the byte-\npair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Sennrich et al.,\n2015), using the implementation from Sentence-\nPiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). Notably, we\nsplit all numbers into individual digits, and fallback\nto bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters.\nparams dimension nheadsnlayers learning rate batch size ntokens\n6.7B 4096 32 32 3:0e\u000044M 1.0T\n13.0B 5120 40 40 3:0e\u000044M 1.0T\n32.5B 6656 52 60 1:5e\u000044M 1.4T\n65.2B 8192 64 80 1:5e\u000044M 1.4T\nTable 2: Model sizes, architectures, and optimization hyper-parameters.\nOverall, our entire training dataset contains\nroughly 1.4T tokens after tokenization. For most of\nour training data, each token is used only once dur-\ning training, with the exception of the Wikipedia\nand Books domains, over which we perform ap-\nproximately two epochs.\n2.2 Architecture\nFollowing recent work on large language models,\nour network is based on the transformer architec-\nture (Vaswani et al., 2017). We leverage various\nimprovements that were subsequently proposed,\nand used in different models such as PaLM. Here\nare the main difference with the original architec-\nture, and where we were found the inspiration for\nthis change (in bracket):\nPre-normalization [GPT3]. To improve the\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\n2\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\nferent models are given in Table 2.\n2.3 Optimizer\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\nlowing hyper-parameters: \f1= 0:9;\f2= 0:95.\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\nthe \ufb01nal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\nmal learning rate. We use a weight decay of 0:1and\ngradient clipping of 1:0. We use 2;000warmup\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nBillion of tokens1.51.61.71.81.92.02.12.2Training lossLLaMA 7B\nLLaMA 13B\nLLaMA 33B\nLLaMA 65BFigure 1: Training loss over train tokens for the 7B,\n13B, 33B, and 65 models.

All models are trained\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\n2.4 Ef\ufb01cient implementation\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\ning speed of our models. First, we use an ef\ufb01cient\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2is\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\nputing the key\/query scores that are masked due to\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\nTo further improve training ef\ufb01ciency, we re-\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\nTo fully bene\ufb01t from this optimization, we need to\n2https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/xformers\nBoolQ PIQA SIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e ARC-c OBQA\nGPT-3 175B 60.5 81.0 - 78.9 70.2 68.8 51.4 57.6\nGopher 280B 79.3 81.8 50.6 79.2 70.1 - - -\nChinchilla 70B 83.7 81.8 51.3 80.8 74.9 - - -\nPaLM 62B 84.8 80.5 - 79.7 77.0 75.2 52.5 50.4\nPaLM-cont 62B 83.9 81.4 - 80.6 77.0 - - -\nPaLM 540B 88.0 82.3 - 83.4 81.1 76.6 53.0 53.4\nLLaMA7B 76.5 79.8 48.9 76.1 70.1 72.8 47.6 57.2\n13B 78.1 80.1 50.4 79.2 73.0 74.8 52.7 56.4\n33B 83.1 82.3 50.4 82.8 76.0 80.0 57.8 58.6\n65B 85.3 82.8 52.3 84.2 77.0 78.9 56.0 60.2\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.\nreduce the memory usage of the model by using\nmodel and sequence parallelism, as described by\nKorthikanti et al. (2022). Moreover, we also over-\nlap the computation of activations and the commu-\nnication between GPUs over the network (due to\nall_reduce operations) as much as possible.\nWhen training a 65B-parameter model, our code\nprocesses around 380 tokens\/sec\/GPU on 2048\nA100 GPU with 80GB of RAM. This means that\ntraining over our dataset containing 1.4T tokens\ntakes approximately 21 days.\n3 Main results\nFollowing previous work (Brown et al., 2020), we\nconsider zero-shot and few-shot tasks, and report\nresults on a total of 20 benchmarks:\n\u2022Zero-shot. We provide a textual description\nof the task and a test example. The model\neither provides an answer using open-ended\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\n\u2022Few-shot. We provide a few examples of the\ntask (between 1 and 64) and a test example.\nThe model takes this text as input and gener-\nates the answer or ranks different options.\nWe compare LLaMA with other foundation mod-\nels, namely the non-publicly available language\nmodels GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Gopher (Rae\net al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\nand PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), as well as\nthe open-sourced OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022),\nGPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-\nNeo (Black et al., 2022). In Section 4, we also\nbrie\ufb02y compare LLaMA with instruction-tuned\nmodels such as OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and\nFlan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022).We evaluate LLaMA on free-form generation\ntasks and multiple choice tasks. In the multiple\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\nappropriate completion among a set of given op-\ntions, based on a provided context. We select the\ncompletion with the highest likelihood given the\nprovided context. We follow Gao et al. (2021)\nand use the likelihood normalized by the number\nof characters in the completion, except for certain\ndatasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we fol-\nlow Brown et al. (2020), and select a completion\nbased on the likelihood normalized by the likeli-\nhood of the completion given \u201cAnswer:\u201d as context:\nP(completionjcontext )=P(completionj\\Answer :\").\n0-shot 1-shot 5-shot 64-shot\nGPT-3 175B 14.6 23.0 - 29.9\nGopher 280B 10.1 - 24.5 28.2\nChinchilla 70B 16.6 - 31.5 35.5\nPaLM8B 8.4 10.6 - 14.6\n62B 18.1 26.5 - 27.6\n540B 21.2 29.3 - 39.6\nLLaMA7B 16.8 18.7 22.0 26.1\n13B 20.1 23.4 28.1 31.9\n33B 24.9 28.3 32.9 36.0\n65B 23.8 31.0 35.0 39.9\nTable 4: NaturalQuestions.

These datasets include Cloze and Winograd\nstyle tasks, as well as multiple choice question an-\nswering. We evaluate in the zero-shot setting as\ndone in the language modeling community.\nIn Table 3, we compare with existing models\nof various sizes and report numbers from the cor-\nresponding papers. First, LLaMA-65B outper-\nforms Chinchilla-70B on all reported benchmarks\nbut BoolQ. Similarly, this model surpasses PaLM-\n540B everywhere but on BoolQ and WinoGrande.\nLLaMA-13B model also outperforms GPT-3 on\nmost benchmarks despite being 10 \u0002smaller.\n3.2 Closed-book Question Answering\nWe compare LLaMA to existing large language\nmodels on two closed-book question answering\nbenchmarks: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski\net al., 2019) and TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017). For\nboth benchmarks, we report exact match perfor-\nmance in a closed book setting, i.e., where the mod-\nels do not have access to documents that contain\nevidence to answer the question. In Table 4, we\nreport performance on NaturalQuestions, and in Ta-\nble 5, we report on TriviaQA. On both benchmarks,\nLLaMA-65B achieve state-of-the-arts performance\nin the zero-shot and few-shot settings. More im-\nportantly, the LLaMA-13B is also competitive on\nthese benchmarks with GPT-3 and Chinchilla, de-\nspite being 5-10 \u0002smaller.

On these benchmarks, LLaMA-65B is\ncompetitive with PaLM-540B, and, LLaMA-13B\noutperforms GPT-3 by a few percents.\n3.4 Mathematical reasoning\nWe evaluate our models on two mathematical rea-\nsoning benchmarks: MATH (Hendrycks et al.,\n2021) and GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021). MATH\nis a dataset of 12K middle school and high school\nmathematics problems written in LaTeX. GSM8k\nis a set of middle school mathematical problems.\nIn Table 7, we compare with PaLM and Min-\nerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Minerva is a series\nof PaLM models \ufb01netuned on 38.5B tokens ex-\ntracted from ArXiv and Math Web Pages, while\nneither PaLM or LLaMA are \ufb01netuned on mathe-\nmatical data. The numbers for PaLM and Minerva\nare taken from Lewkowycz et al. (2022), and we\ncompare with and without maj1@k .maj1@k de-\nnotes evaluations where we generate ksamples for\neach problem and perform a majority voting (Wang\net al., 2022). On GSM8k, we observe that LLaMA-\n65B outperforms Minerva-62B, although it has not\nbeen \ufb01ne-tuned on mathematical data.\n3.5 Code generation\nWe evaluate the ability of our models to write\ncode from a natural language description on two\nbenchmarks: HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021). For both tasks, the\nmodel receives a description of the program in a\nfew sentences, as well as a few input-output ex-\namples. In HumanEval, it also receives a function\nsignature, and the prompt is formatted as natural\ncode with the textual description and tests in a\nMATH +maj1@k GSM8k +maj1@k\nPaLM8B 1.5 - 4.1 -\n62B 4.4 - 33.0 -\n540B 8.8 - 56.5 -\nMinerva8B 14.1 25.4 16.2 28.4\n62B 27.6 43.4 52.4 68.5\n540B 33.6 50.3 68.5 78.5\nLLaMA7B 2.9 6.9 11.0 18.1\n13B 3.9 8.8 17.8 29.3\n33B 7.1 15.2 35.6 53.1\n65B 10.6 20.5 50.9 69.7\nTable 7: Model performance on quantitative reason-\ning datasets. For majority voting, we use the same\nsetup as Minerva, with k= 256 samples for MATH\nandk= 100 for GSM8k (Minerva 540B uses k= 64\nfor MATH and and k= 40 for GSM8k). LLaMA-65B\noutperforms Minerva 62B on GSM8k, although it has\nnot been \ufb01ne-tuned on mathematical data.\ndocstring. The model needs to generate a Python\nprogram that \ufb01ts the description and satis\ufb01es the\ntest cases. In Table 8, we compare the pass@1\nscores of our models with existing language mod-\nels that have not been \ufb01netuned on code, namely\nPaLM and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022). PaLM\nand LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain\na similar number of code tokens.\nAs show in Table 8, for a similar number\nof parameters, LLaMA outperforms other gen-\neral models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which\nare not trained or \ufb01netuned speci\ufb01cally for code.\nLLaMA with 13B parameters and more outper-\nforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and\nMBPP. LLaMA 65B also outperforms PaLM 62B,\neven when it is trained longer. The pass@1 results\nreported in this table were obtained by sampling\nwith temperature 0.1. The pass@100 and pass@80\nmetrics were obtained with temperature 0.8. We\nuse the same method as Chen et al. (2021) to obtain\nunbiased estimates of the pass@k.\nIt is possible to improve the performance on code\nby \ufb01netuning on code-speci\ufb01c tokens. For instance,\nPaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022) increases\nthe pass@1 score of PaLM on HumanEval from\n26.2% for PaLM to 36%. Other models trained\nspeci\ufb01cally for code also perform better than gen-\neral models on these tasks (Chen et al., 2021; Ni-\njkamp et al., 2022; Fried et al., 2022).

(2020) consists of multiple choice questions\ncovering various domains of knowledge, includ-\ning humanities, STEM and social sciences. We\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\nmodels on a few question answering and common\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\nof the model (see Figure 1). The exceptions are\nSIQA and WinoGrande. Most notably, on SIQA,\nwe observe a lot of variance in performance,\nHumanities STEM Social Sciences Other Average\nGPT-NeoX 20B 29.8 34.9 33.7 37.7 33.6\nGPT-3 175B 40.8 36.7 50.4 48.8 43.9\nGopher 280B 56.2 47.4 71.9 66.1 60.0\nChinchilla 70B 63.6 54.9 79.3 73.9 67.5\nPaLM8B 25.6 23.8 24.1 27.8 25.4\n62B 59.5 41.9 62.7 55.8 53.7\n540B 77.0 55.6 81.0 69.6 69.3\nLLaMA7B 34.0 30.5 38.3 38.1 35.1\n13B 45.0 35.8 53.8 53.3 46.9\n33B 55.8 46.0 66.7 63.4 57.8\n65B 61.8 51.7 72.9 67.4 63.4\nTable 9: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU).

On WinoGrande, the performance does\nnot correlate as well with training perplexity:\nthe LLaMA-33B and LLaMA-65B have similar\nperformance during the training.\n4 Instruction Finetuning\nIn this section, we show that brie\ufb02y \ufb01netuning on\ninstructions data rapidly leads to improvements\non MMLU. Although the non-\ufb01netuned version\nof LLaMA-65B is already able to follow basic in-\nstructions, we observe that a very small amount of\n\ufb01netuning improves the performance on MMLU,\nand further improves the ability of the model to\nfollow instructions. Since this is not the focus of\nthis paper, we only conducted a single experiment\nfollowing the same protocol as Chung et al. (2022)\nto train an instruct model, LLaMA-I.\nOPT 30B 26.1\nGLM 120B 44.8\nPaLM 62B 55.1\nPaLM-cont 62B 62.8\nChinchilla 70B 67.5\nLLaMA 65B 63.4\nOPT-IML-Max 30B 43.2\nFlan-T5-XXL 11B 55.1\nFlan-PaLM 62B 59.6\nFlan-PaLM-cont 62B 66.1\nLLaMA-I 65B 68.9\nTable 10: Instruction \ufb01netuning \u2013 MMLU (5-shot).\nComparison of models of moderate size with and with-\nout instruction \ufb01netuning on MMLU.In Table 10, we report the results of our instruct\nmodel LLaMA-I on MMLU and compare with ex-\nisting instruction \ufb01netuned models of moderate\nsizes, namely, OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and the\nFlan-PaLM series (Chung et al., 2022). All the re-\nported numbers are from the corresponding papers.\nDespite the simplicity of the instruction \ufb01netuning\napproach used here, we reach 68.9% on MMLU.\nLLaMA-I (65B) outperforms on MMLU existing\ninstruction \ufb01netuned models of moderate sizes, but\nare still far from the state-of-the-art, that is 77.4\nfor GPT code-davinci-002 on MMLU (numbers\ntaken from Iyer et al. (2022)). The details of the\nperformance on MMLU on the 57 tasks can be\nfound in Table 16 of the appendix.\n5 Bias, Toxicity and Misinformation\nLarge language models have been showed to re-\nproduce and amplify biases that are existing in\nthe training data (Sheng et al., 2019; Kurita et al.,\n2019), and to generate toxic or offensive con-\ntent (Gehman et al., 2020). As our training dataset\ncontains a large proportion of data from the Web,\nwe believe that it is crucial to determine the po-\ntential for our models to generate such content.\nTo understand the potential harm of LLaMA-65B,\nwe evaluate on different benchmarks that measure\ntoxic content production and stereotypes detection.\nWhile we have selected some of the standard bench-\nmarks that are used by the language model com-\nmunity to indicate some of the issues with these\nmodels, these evaluations are not suf\ufb01cient to fully\nunderstand the risks associated with these models.\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500203040506070AccuracyTriviaQA\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 15005055606570758085HellaSwag\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 150005101520253035NaturalQuestions\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\nBillion of tokens40424446485052AccuracySIQA\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\nBillion of tokens50556065707580WinoGrande\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\nBillion of tokens65.067.570.072.575.077.580.082.5PIQA\nLLaMA 7B\nLLaMA 13B\nLLaMA 33B\nLLaMA 65B\nChinchillaFigure 2: Evolution of performance on question answering and common sense reasoning during training.\n5.1 RealToxicityPrompts\nLanguage models can generate toxic language, e.g.,\ninsults, hate speech or threats. There is a very large\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI3.\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\nwith previous models dif\ufb01cult.\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\n\u201ccomparable\u201d with what we observe in the litera-\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\n3https:\/\/perspectiveapi.com\/Basic Respectful\nLLaMA7B 0.106 0.081\n13B 0.104 0.095\n33B 0.107 0.087\n65B 0.128 0.141\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\n\u201crespectful\u201d versions are prompts starting with \u201cCom-\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\nunbiased manner:\u201d, and \u201cBasic\u201d is without it. Scores\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\napply within a model family.\nLLaMA GPT3 OPT\nGender 70.6 62.6 65.7\nReligion 79.0 73.3 68.6\nRace\/Color 57.0 64.7 68.6\nSexual orientation 81.0 76.2 78.6\nAge 70.1 64.4 67.8\nNationality 64.2 61.6 62.9\nDisability 66.7 76.7 76.7\nPhysical appearance 77.8 74.6 76.2\nSocioeconomic status 71.5 73.8 76.2\nAverage 66.6 67.2 69.5\nTable 12: CrowS-Pairs. We compare the level of bi-\nases contained in LLaMA-65B with OPT-175B and\nGPT3-175B. Higher score indicates higher bias.\n5.2 CrowS-Pairs\nWe evaluate the biases in our model on the CrowS-\nPairs (Nangia et al., 2020). This dataset allows to\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\nrace\/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\nspite multiple \ufb01ltering steps.\n5.3 WinoGender\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\ntions: an \u201coccupation\u201d, a \u201cparticipant\u201d, and a\n\u201cpronoun\u201d where the pronoun is co-referencing\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\nand measure if it does so correctly according tothe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\nif societal biases associated with occupations\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is \u201cThe\nnurse noti\ufb01ed the patient that his shift would be\nending in an hour.\u201d, which is followed by \u2018His\u2019\nrefers to . We then compare the perplexity of the\ncontinuations the nurse andthe patient to per-\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\n\u201cher\/her\/she\u201d, \u201chis\/him\/he\u201d and \u201ctheir\/them\/some-\none\u201d (the different choices corresponding to the\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\ndataset. We observe that our model is signi\ufb01cantly\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\nthe \u201ctheir\/them\/someone\u201d pronouns than for the\n\u201cher\/her\/she\u201d and \u201chis\/him\/he\u201d pronouns. A simi-\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\n\u201cher\/her\/she\u201d and \u201chis\/him\/he\u201d pronouns, the model\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\nat the set of \u201cgotcha\u201d cases for the \u201cher\/her\/she\u201d\nand \u201chis\/him\/he\u201d pronouns in the WinoGender\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\nThe drop of performance exists for \u201cher\/her\/she\u201d\nand \u201chis\/him\/he\u201d pronouns, which is indicative of\nbiases regardless of gender.\n5.4 TruthfulQA\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\nwhen a claim is true. Lin et al. (2021) consider\nthe de\ufb01nition of \u201ctrue\u201d in the sense of \u201cliteral truth\nabout the real world\u201d, and not claims that are only\ntrue in the context of a belief system or tradition.\nThis benchmark can evaluate the risks of a model\nto generate misinformation or false claims. The\nquestions are written in diverse style, cover 38 cat-\negories and are designed to be adversarial.\n7B 13B 33B 65B\nAll 66.0 64.7 69.0 77.5\nher\/her\/she 65.0 66.7 66.7 78.8\nhis\/him\/he 60.8 62.5 62.1 72.1\ntheir\/them\/someone 72.1 65.0 78.3 81.7\nher\/her\/she ( gotcha ) 64.2 65.8 61.7 75.0\nhis\/him\/he ( gotcha ) 55.0 55.8 55.8 63.3\nTable 13: WinoGender.

(2022), and\nreport the performance of GPT-3 from the same paper.\nIn Table 14, we report the performance of our\nmodels on both questions to measure truthful mod-\nels and the intersection of truthful and informative.\nCompared to GPT-3, our model scores higher in\nboth categories, but the rate of correct answers is\nstill low, showing that our model is likely to hallu-\ncinate incorrect answers.\n6 Carbon footprint\nThe training of our models have consumed a mas-\nsive quantity of energy, responsible for the emis-\nsion of carbon dioxide. We follow the recent liter-\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\nsions, tCO 2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\nWh =GPU-h\u0002(GPU power consumption )\u0002PUE;where we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\nat1:1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\n0.057 kg CO 2eq\/KWh leading to 27 tCO 2eq and\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO 2eq\/KWh, lead-\ning to 82 tCO 2eq. In this study, we are interested in\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\nof these models if they were trained in the same\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\n0.385 kg CO 2eq\/KWh. This leads to the following\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\ntCO2eq=MWh\u00020:385:\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO 2eq.\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\n7 Related work\nLanguage models are probability distributions\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\nby using language through the \u201cimitation game\u201d,\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\nmark to measure progress toward arti\ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\n4https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/metaseq\/\ntree\/main\/projects\/OPT\/chronicles\nGPU TypeGPU PowerGPU-hoursTotal power Carbon emitted\nconsumption consumption (tCO 2eq)\nOPT-175B A100-80GB 400W 809,472 356 MWh 137\nBLOOM-175B A100-80GB 400W 1,082,880 475 MWh 183\nLLaMA-7B A100-80GB 400W 82,432 36 MWh 14\nLLaMA-13B A100-80GB 400W 135,168 59 MWh 23\nLLaMA-33B A100-80GB 400W 530,432 233 MWh 90\nLLaMA-65B A100-80GB 400W 1,022,362 449 MWh 173\nTable 15: Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022)\nto compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power\nconsumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO 2e per KWh.\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the bene\ufb01ts of\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff ,\nHea\ufb01eld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\nmeasure the progress of language models.\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\n2020). A signi\ufb01cant breakthrough was obtained\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\nLarge Language Models , such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\net al. (2020) derived power laws speci\ufb01cally for\ntransformer based language models, which were\nlater re\ufb01ned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\ning on the abilities of large language models.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\nbeing more than 10 \u0002smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\nreleasing these models to the research community\nwill accelerate the development of large language\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\n(2022) that \ufb01netuning these models on instructions\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.\nA Question Answering\nWe evaluate LLaMA on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. For Natural Questions we use the test split used\nfor open-domain question answering containing 3610 questions. For TriviaQA we evaluate on the dev set\nof the \ufb01ltered set. This differs from GPT-3 and PaLM, which evaluate on the test set of the un\ufb01ltered set\nfor which the online evaluation server is not available anymore5.\nWe generate answers using greedy decoding, and extract an answer from the generation by stopping\nat the \ufb01rst line break, \ufb01nal dot or comma. Generated answers are evaluated with the standard exact\nmatch metric: a generated answer is considered correct if it matches any answer of the list of answers\nafter normalization. For this normalization step we lowercase generated answers and remove articles,\npunctuation and duplicate whitespaces. Figure 3 presents formatted examples in the 1-shot setting for\nNatural Questions and TriviaQA respectively. In all settings, we preprend the string Answer these\nquestions:\\n to the list of questions and answers.\nContext!Answer these questions: Context!Answer these questions:\nQ: Who sang who wants to be a millionaire in high society?

We listened to it and\nhere\u2019s what we thought:\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most in\ufb02uential computer scientists\nof the last decade. LeCun\u2019s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the \ufb01eld of deep learning, covering a range of\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\nYann LeCun, the rap game\u2019s newest emcee.\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun\u2019s \ufb02ow is surprisingly good, and\nhe\u2019s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album\u2019s production is solid, the sound is a little\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the songs.\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\ngood. He sings:\nWe gotta think about the future, it\u2019s gonna be here soon \/ Maybe we can even put some AI\nin the moon \/ Think about the children, think about the next generation \/ Let\u2019s make sure\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\nLeCun\u2019s rap \ufb02ow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\nfuture of AI. LeCun\u2019s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\nIt\u2019s all about the learning \/ it\u2019s all about the network \/ It\u2019s all about the training \/ it\u2019s all\nabout the perception.\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\nwatch)\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it\u2019s more than just a watch. It\u2019s a minicomputer. You program it\nany way you want. It\u2019s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\nand a modem. I think it even makes cappuccino.\"\nJerry: \"Where are you getting this stuff?\"\nGeorge: \"From my ad copy. Look, Jerry, it\u2019s not a watch. It\u2019s an organizer, a personal\nassistant, and a dictaphone. You can play chess against it. And, you know, if you want to,\nyou can program it to speak in foreign languages. It\u2019s a microprocessor, Jerry.\"\nJerry: \"George, if you had one of these, would you wear it?\"\nGeorge: \"I\u2019m wearing it right now.\"\nJerry: \"I don\u2019t see anything on your wrist.\"\nGeorge: \"That\u2019s because it\u2019s a microprocessor.\"\nThe sun goes down, and \ufb01nally Gauss and Curie \ufb01nd time to relax and discuss after\nan exhausting day of work.\nGauss: Hey, Curie, did you know that a lot of people consider me to be the \ufb01rst geek?\nCurie: What\u2019s a geek?\nGauss: Well, Wikipedia says that a geek is \u201ca person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively,\nby obscure or very speci\ufb01c areas of knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual\nin nature\u201d.\nCurie: And how do they think you are a geek?\nGauss: Well, have you ever seen this picture?\nCurie: Awww!\nGauss: That\u2019s right! I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\n\ufb01rst message on the \ufb01rst commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\nGermany.\nCurie: Wow! The \ufb01rst telegraph! And what did you send?\nGauss: I sent the Latin phrase \u201cnumquam retrorsum\u201d which means \u201cNever backwards\u201d.\nCurie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the \ufb01rst person to communicate using\nthe telegraph, you were the \ufb01rst geek?\nGauss: Well, the word \u201cgeek\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think\nthat the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media.\nCurie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter?\nGauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the \ufb01rst person to use it!\nCurie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of\n11 characters.\nGauss: That\u2019s right. I managed to do more with less.\nCurie: So you think you were the \ufb01rst geek because you used less characters to say the\nsame thing?\nGauss: I was the \ufb01rst person to send the \ufb01rst message using an early form of social media.\nCurie: OK, you\u2019re right, Gauss. I think you have a case.\nD Generations from LLaMA-I\nWe show a few examples of generations with LLaMA-I, i.e. LLaMA-65B \ufb01ne-tuned with the protocol\nand instruction dataset from Chung et al.

These openings are popular because they are effective at countering\nwhite\u2019s early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the\ncenter of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and\nthe Scotch Game.\nthe same in a list, with the \ufb01rst few moves\nHere is a list of some popular chess openings, with the \ufb01rst few moves for each opening:\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5\nplease provide the two \ufb01rst moves for each one\nHere are the \ufb01rst 2 moves for each of the openings:\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6\nthe last two seem identical\nYes, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game are very similar - they are both \"open\" games,\nwhich means that white plays aggressively and tries to control the center of the board. The\nItalian Game is considered slightly more aggressive, while the Scotch Game is considered\nslightly more positional.\nfrom which move do they differ?\nThe Italian Game and the Scotch Game differ after white\u2019s third move. In the Italian Game,\nwhite will play the move 3. Bc4, while in the Scotch Game white will play the move 3. Qf3.\nThese moves lead to very different positions, and white will have different strategic goals\nin each case. For example, in the Italian Game white will try to control the center with his\npieces, while in the Scotch Game white will try to attack black\u2019s position directly.\nwrite a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by\nSure! Here\u2019s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of\nsand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terri\ufb01ed that I would soon be\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to \ufb01nd that this new\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\nour little world.\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\nforms are much more horri\ufb01c, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\napproach or pet strange cats!\nWrite a shouting match between Julius Caesar and Napoleon\nOf course! Here is a conversation between Julius Caesar and Napoleon:\nJulius Caesar: You\u2019re nothing but a glory hound, Napoleon. You\u2019ve always been more\nconcerned with your own fame and fortune than with the people you\u2019re supposed to be\nleading.\nNapoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You\u2019re no better than I am. At least I\u2019m honest\nabout my ambitions. You\u2019re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\nyou line your own pockets.\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I\u2019ve conquered\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\nfor myself.\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I\u2019ve done everything in my power to\ntry to stop it, but there\u2019s only so much one man can do.\nNapoleon: And yet you\u2019re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\nthough it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re not the one who\u2019s really in charge.\nJulius Caesar: That\u2019s not true! I am in charge, and I\u2019m going to make Rome great again.\nJust watch me.\nNapoleon: I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\nHere is a draft email you could send:\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

I would love to meet a wide variety of people, but if\nI had to narrow it down to 5 speci\ufb01c individuals, I would choose:\n\u2022Albert Einstein - One of the greatest minds in history, Einstein\u2019s contributions to\nphysics and science are legendary. I would love to have the opportunity to talk with\nhim about his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics, and get his insights on the\ncurrent state of physics.\n\u2022Leonardo da Vinci - Da Vinci is one of the most brilliant and multi-talented people in\nhistory, and I would love to meet him and discuss his diverse interests and areas of\nexpertise. I would also be very interested in getting his insights on the art world of his\ntime period.\n\u2022Socrates - One of the founders of Western philosophy, Socrates is a hugely important\nand in\ufb02uential \ufb01gure in the history of ideas. I would be very interested in talking with\nhim about his philosophical beliefs and his teachings.\n\u2022William Shakespeare - Arguably the greatest writer in English literature, Shakespeare\nis a towering \ufb01gure in world culture. I would love to have the chance to talk with him\nabout his works and his life.\n\u2022Abraham Lincoln - One of the most important and in\ufb02uential presidents in American\nhistory, Lincoln led the country through the Civil War and issued the Emancipation\nProclamation, freeing all slaves in the United States. I would be very interested in\ntalking with him about his presidency and his views on the issues of his time period.\nCould you explain me the main contribution of the \ufb01rst person you mentioned\nEinstein\u2019s contributions to physics and science are legendary. His theory of relativity is one\nof the foundational theories of modern physics, and his discovery of the law of photons\nand light revolutionized our understanding of light and radiation. He also made important\ncontributions to quantum mechanics, and his many scienti\ufb01c papers and lectures have had a\ntremendous impact on modern physics. Without a doubt, Einstein is one of the most brilliant\nand in\ufb02uential physicists in history, and his many contributions have had a profound impact\non our understanding of the universe.\nWhat is the most famous equation from this theory?\nThe most famous equation from Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is E=mc2. This equation\nstates that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light ( c2), and it is one of\nthe most well-known and celebrated equations in the history of science. The equation\nsummarizes one of the most important and revolutionary concepts in modern physics, and\nit has had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the universe.\nYou are a bash terminal.
