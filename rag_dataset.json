We train our models on trillions\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In\nparticular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3\n(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-\n65B is competitive with the best models,\nChinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release\nall our models to the research community1.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\nproperties \ufb01rst appeared when scaling models to a\nsuf\ufb01cient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\nfastest at inference, and although it may"

            "reference_answer": "The approach of LLaMA in training language models differs from the traditional approach of using proprietary and inaccessible datasets by exclusively utilizing publicly available datasets. This means that LLaMA models are trained on trillions of tokens using data that is accessible to the research community, without the need for proprietary or inaccessible datasets.\n\nIn terms of performance, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of training state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets. Additionally, LLaMA-65B is competitive with other large language models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve comparable performance without relying on the largest models.\n\nOverall, the LLaMA approach highlights the importance of training models on more data rather than simply increasing the number of parameters. By focusing on scaling datasets and model sizes effectively, LLaMA has been able to achieve impressive performance levels with models like LLaMA-13B and LLaMA-65B, showcasing the potential of using publicly available datasets for training large language models.",

We\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\nmodels on a few question answering and common\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\nof the model (see Figure 1). The exceptions are\nSIQA and WinoGrande. Most notably, on SIQA,\nwe observe a lot of variance in performance,\nHumanities STEM Social Sciences Other Average\nGPT-NeoX 20B 29.8 34.9 33.7 37.7"

            "reference_answer": "Scaling in language models is crucial for improving model performance. Historically, scaling has been applied to both the model and dataset sizes. Increasing the model size allows for more parameters and complexity, which can lead to better performance in capturing intricate patterns and dependencies in language data. On the other hand, scaling the dataset size provides more diverse and abundant training data, enabling the model to learn more effectively and generalize better to unseen data.\n\nIn the context of language models, scaling has been shown to be beneficial for various types of models, including feed forward models, recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, and transformer networks. Larger models with more parameters have been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies and improving overall model capacity.\n\nOverall, scaling in terms of both model and dataset sizes plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of language models, allowing them to achieve better accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capabilities.",

                "and GLM (Zeng et al.,\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\net al. (2020) derived power laws speci\ufb01cally for\ntransformer based language models, which were\nlater re\ufb01ned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\ning on the abilities of large language models.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\nbeing more than 10 \u0002smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\nreleasing these models to the research community\nwill accelerate the development of large language\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\n(2022) that \ufb01netuning these models on instructions\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Jeremy\nReizenstein, Artem Korenev, and Patrick Labatut\nfrom the xformers team.

It is an in\ufb01nite sequence\nwhich appears to grow very rapidly, at least in its initial terms. It is perhaps the most famous\nsequence in mathematics, for it pops up everywhere.
